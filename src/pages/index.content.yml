    largeFeature:
      Header: Full width feature
      Content: This will be for “showcase” items — large releases/updates. Will likely
        feature an image along with heading, body copy, and link (either text or
        button — tbd)

    mediumFeature:
      Header: Medium feature
      Content: Will serve as an intermediate block for when there aren’t a ton of new
        updates, but we still want to make an impact visually, but not compete
        with the main feature. These would need heading, body copy, and link.
        Image is optional, but wouldn’t be full width/background.

      Header: Small feature
      Content: Smaller impact, themed curated list of new items. Likely linked ULs
        with possible H4 heading format to cateogorize as needed. Could be
        repeated to fill a row.
