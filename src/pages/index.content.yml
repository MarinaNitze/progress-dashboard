    mediumFeature:
      Header: Medium feature
      Content: Will serve as an intermediate block for when there aren’t a ton of new
        updates, but we still want to make an impact visually, but not compete
        with the main feature. These would need heading, body copy, and link.
        Image is optional, but wouldn’t be full width/background.
