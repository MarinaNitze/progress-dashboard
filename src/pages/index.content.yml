      content: Inconsistencies in how we conduct background checks are putting
        children at risk. To solve this problem, we need to approach it from
        both sides — how we fulfill background check requests and how we make
        these requests.

      We’re working with experts from across the country to identify and
      document practical, scalable strategies for improving child welfare.
      Everything in this playbook comes from [our growing community of child
      welfare practitioners](https://www.childwelfareplaybook.com/about) —
      whether it’s tips for improving background checks or resources for finding
      family members.


      This playbook is designed specifically for you to copy these ideas. (Seriously, you don’t need to ask us – just take whatever you find useful!)


      This playbook is the result of a collaboration between states at the cutting edge of child welfare and [New America’s Public Interest Technology team](https://www.newamerica.org/pit/), in partnership with [Foster America](https://www.foster-america.org/) and [Think of Us](https://www.thinkof-us.org/).
