    about: Child welfare programs are required to check the child abuse and neglect
      registry in each state that a potential foster parent has lived in during
      the past 5 years. This is called the “Adam Walsh check” after the 2006 act
      that requires it. Programs must also do this for anyone else in the home
      who’s 18 years or older.
    why: >-
      Flaws and inconsistencies in states’ background check processes are: 


      * Putting children at risk. Some states only respond to requests when someone doesn’t pass the background check. This means that foster care programs don’t know if a potential foster parent passed the background check or whether the paperwork was lost. 

      * Causing delays in licensing foster parents. Foster care programs have to decide how long to wait for a potential response to a background check request. While they’re waiting, children need placement. 

      * Adding to the financial burden of relatives. Some programs don’t financially support relative placements until they are fully licensed. Delays in out-of-state background checks translate into weeks or months of grandmothers struggling to make ends meet while caring for their grandchildren.


      We can eliminate these inefficiencies. But to solve this problem, we need to approach it from both sides — how we fulfill background check requests and how we make these requests.
    what: >-
      ### **Make it easier for people to request background checks from your
      state.**


      **Don’t charge a fee.** It’s so difficult for some states to issue a check to another state — even for a few dollars — that many licensing workers report paying these fees out of their own pockets. The vast majority of states don’t charge any fees.


      **Don’t require a notarized signature.** It’s very difficult for a social worker to gather all household applicants together at one time to visit a notary. The vast majority of states don’t require a notarized signature.


      **Accept requests electronically.** Whether you build an online portal or process email requests, this will allow you to process requests more efficiently. See the foster care programs that already do this. 


      **Respond to all requests.** Without a response, the requestor doesn’t know whether the applicant passed the check or if the request was lost.


      ### **Improve your process for requesting out-of-state background checks.**


      **Collect information early.** Ask whether applicants and the other adults in their household lived in other states in the last 5 years as early as possible in the process. For example, if your application process includes a “mini” application or a “pre-application” form, ask there. 


      **Start background checks early.** Submit out-of-state requests as early as possible in your process. Review licensing worker checklists and move this step towards the top of the list.

    about: Children do better when they’re placed with family members or other known
      adults., But identifying and connecting with extended family members can
      be a challenge for foster care programs.
    why: >-
      Children can’t have too many adults who care about them. A strong support
      system of adults supports young people’s resiliency and long term health
      and well-being. 


      But most youth enter foster care with more connections than they leave with.
    what: >-
      **Ask young people.** Children often have more supportive people in their
      lives than you — or they — realize. And the ways you ask children about
      their networks can get different results. For example, try questions like,
      “If you were stuck and needed a ride, who would you call?” 


      **Use social media and other locator tools.** Some business models rely on the ability to find and connect people who may know each other. You can use these tools, like credit bureaus and social media sites, in your search for a child’s family. 


      **Try the “snowball method.”** The “snowball method” is when you ask one contact for more contacts. Each time you connect with someone in a child’s life, ask them for suggestions of other people to contact. 


      **Document as you go.** Support networks can get complicated. Find a template that works for you — like a genogram — and keep it up to date as you identify more connections.
