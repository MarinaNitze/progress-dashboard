    about: Foster parent licensing can be a lengthy, and at times inefficient,
      process. Delays in licensing can mean losing homes in a time when
      placement options are already severely limited.
    why: The licensing process is key to ensuring child safety and foster family
      preparedness. While it is important to be thorough, delays in the process
      can overburden licensing workers and inspectors or even risk losing
      families.
    what: >-


      * **Increase support for licensing workers.** Providing clerical support for licensing workers will help staff maintain a higher case load, while increasing family satisfaction. If you can give families a dedicated licensor through the whole process, staff will be able to reduce the likelihood of errors while developing a more holistic picture of the family. 

      * **Make safety inspections easier for families.** Some families do not pass the inspection on the first try simply because they were missing one or more items that they didn’t know they needed. When an inspector has to return, it can make the licensing process longer and takes more resources. By providing families with a checklist of safety items ahead of time, as well as providing families with items they need but cannot acquire, you can streamline the safety inspection process and avoid delays.

      * **Continue licensing and training while social distancing.** Some agencies paused their licensing or training during the pandemic. However, federal regulations do not require that these processes take place in person. By providing foster parent training online and conducting key parts of the licensing process remotely (like doing the initial safety walkthrough over video), you can avoid having to halt your licensing and training work.

    layout: topic
    title: out-of-state-background-checks
    image: /src/images/topics/Topic-BC.svg
    about:
      Child welfare programs are required to check the child abuse and neglect
      registry in each state that a potential foster parent has lived in during
      the past 5 years. This is called the “Adam Walsh check” after the 2006 act
      that requires it. Programs must also do this for anyone else in the home
      who’s 18 years or older.
    why: >-
      Flaws and inconsistencies in states’ background check processes are: 


      * Putting children at risk. Some states only respond to requests when someone doesn’t pass the background check. This means that foster care programs don’t know if a potential foster parent passed the background check or whether the paperwork was lost. 

      * Causing delays in licensing foster parents. Foster care programs have to decide how long to wait for a potential response to a background check request. While they’re waiting, children need placement. 

      * Adding to the financial burden of relatives. Some programs don’t financially support relative placements until they are fully licensed. Delays in out-of-state background checks translate into weeks or months of grandmothers struggling to make ends meet while caring for their grandchildren.


      We can eliminate these inefficiencies. But to solve this problem, we need to approach it from both sides — how we fulfill background check requests and how we make these requests.
    what: >-
      ### **Make it easier for people to request background checks from your
      state.**


      **Don’t charge a fee.** It’s so difficult for some states to issue a check to another state — even for a few dollars — that many licensing workers report paying these fees out of their own pockets. The vast majority of states don’t charge any fees.


      **Don’t require a notarized signature.** It’s very difficult for a social worker to gather all household applicants together at one time to visit a notary. The vast majority of states don’t require a notarized signature.


      **Accept requests electronically.** Whether you build an online portal or process email requests, this will allow you to process requests more efficiently. See the foster care programs that already do this. 


      **Respond to all requests.** Without a response, the requestor doesn’t know whether the applicant passed the check or if the request was lost.


      ### **Improve your process for requesting out-of-state background checks.**


      **Collect information early.** Ask whether applicants and the other adults in their household lived in other states in the last 5 years as early as possible in the process. For example, if your application process includes a “mini” application or a “pre-application” form, ask there. 


      **Start background checks early.** Submit out-of-state requests as early as possible in your process. Review licensing worker checklists and move this step towards the top of the list.

    about:
      The end of foster care can be a difficult or confusing time for youth.
      However, there are several important ways that staff can better prepare
      and support youth during this time.
    why:
      Youth can often be confused about the end of foster care, even about the
      date foster care will end. This means that youth may miss out on
      opportunities to build independence or connections.
    what: >-


      * **Be specific about the end of foster care.** Youth often report confusion about the day foster care ends, as they may misunderstand “until 21” to mean that care continues until their 22nd birthday. Using specific language about when foster care ends will ensure that youth are better prepared and not accidentally delaying plans or activities that can prepare them for independence.

      * **Make sure youth know their options.** Allowing youth to explore and select available programs means youth can better select the topics most relevant to them, as case workers are often too busy to explain each program. If possible, providing positions within your agency for youth with lived experience is a valuable way to center lived experiences of care in your work, while providing employment options to youth. 

      * **Make it easier to receive Extended Foster Care stipends.** Youth often report that direct deposited funds or cash is more useful than store-specific gift cards. Requiring youth to pick up a check in person each month can also put a burden on youth who are in college, working, or don’t have access to adequate transportation.

    about:
      Children do better when they’re placed with family members or other known
      adults., But identifying and connecting with extended family members can
      be a challenge for foster care programs.
    why: >-
      Children can’t have too many adults who care about them. A strong support
      system of adults supports young people’s resiliency and long term health
      and well-being. 


      But most youth enter foster care with more connections than they leave with.
    what: >-
      **Ask young people.** Children often have more supportive people in their
      lives than you — or they — realize. And the ways you ask children about
      their networks can get different results. For example, try questions like,
      “If you were stuck and needed a ride, who would you call?” 


      **Use social media and other locator tools.** Some business models rely on the ability to find and connect people who may know each other. You can use these tools, like credit bureaus and social media sites, in your search for a child’s family. 


      **Try the “snowball method.”** The “snowball method” is when you ask one contact for more contacts. Each time you connect with someone in a child’s life, ask them for suggestions of other people to contact. 


      **Document as you go.** Support networks can get complicated. Find a template that works for you — like a genogram — and keep it up to date as you identify more connections.

    title: inquiry-management
    image: /src/images/topics/Topic-IM.svg
    about:
      Responding to and tracking inquiries from potential foster families can
      be time consuming, but represents a key moment for engagement and
      successful recruitment.
    why: Potential families may fill out an inquiry form when they are ready to
      apply the next day, or the next year. Remaining proactive in your inquiry
      management process can mean keeping families engaged over the months or
      years as they decide to complete an application to become a foster family,
      while allowing families who are ready to move to the application process
      quickly.
    what: >-


      * **Respond to inquiries quickly.** If too much time passes after a family completes an inquiry form, a potential caregiver may become discouraged, second guess themselves, or change their mind. Responding quickly and providing more information will help families to immediately feel engaged and supported, while allowing those who are ready to complete an application more quickly. 

      * **Stay in touch with families.** Some families may take years to decide they’re ready to become a foster family. Closing inquiries after a certain time period has elapsed risks losing these potential caregivers. Instead, stay in touch with families who inquire through email newsletters, personal check-ins, or by offering other ways to support foster youth without or before becoming a foster parent. 

      * **Leverage inquiry data.** You can use the data from incoming inquiries, such as zip code or languages spoken, to highlight any gaps in your recruitment. Additionally, by tracking detailed referral information from new inquiries, you can better understand which recruitment methods are most successful.

    about: License renewal can be a time-consuming process for both staff and
      families, but a successful license renewal process can ensure better
      retention and increased family satisfaction.
    why:
      Maintaining up-to-date licenses is key for ensuring child safety and foster
      family preparedness. The license renewal process can also provide an
      opportunity for staff to connect with foster families, maintaining family
      engagement and increasing retention.
    what: >-


      * **Use electronic tools to increase understanding and engagement.** Emailing renewal requirements to families can decrease the chances of important documents going unnoticed in the large amount of mail that families receive from agencies. Additionally, families often have multiple renewal dates pending, for items like CPR recertification or pet vaccines. Using an electronic calendar to track and send reminders for these items helps families to be better prepared at renewal time. 

      * **Take the opportunity to check-in with families.** Using renewal as an opportunity to check-in with families will help staff identify families who may be feeling overwhelmed, as well as those who may be interested in increasing their training and taking on more responsibility.

    about:
      Foster family recruitment is vital to ensuring a wide pool of placement
      options for youth in care. Innovative programs are finding a variety of
      creative ways for successfully recruiting new foster families.
    why:
      Successful recruitment means that youth in care can be placed with families
      who are in their existing community and culture, or who speak the same
      language. Identifying the families most needed is helpful, but must be
      followed by intentional recruitment methods targeting the communities or
      types of families most needed.
    what: >-


      * **Be specific and intentional in recruitment.** Use data about the youth who currently need placements, as well as the data from incoming foster family inquiries, to identify the gaps in your current recruitment. Once those gaps are identified, you can tailor your recruitment materials and methods to better reflect your community and the families most needed. Additionally, be clear in your materials that homes are needed for foster care, not the adoption of infants. Clarity early in the process will help potential foster families make the right choice for themselves, as well as help staff focus on the families most needed for placements.

      * **Make the recruitment, application, and placement process seamless.** By including recruiters in follow up activities with potential foster families, you can increase family satisfaction and prevent losing potential families, who may feel confused or unsupported if they’re passed off between multiple staff members. Recruiters should also be included in your routine case management and placement meetings, as they can help identify any pending families who are good matches for current youth. Once identified, you will be able to prioritize licensing these matching families. 

      * **Include current foster families in recruitment efforts**. Positive word of mouth can be a valuable tool in recruiting potential foster families. You can encourage current foster families to help recruit other families by providing financial bonuses for any referrals, or when referrals complete major milestones like completing an application. Hiring current foster parents as trainers or for an orientation can also help current foster parents feel valued, while providing valuable information and perspectives to new families.
