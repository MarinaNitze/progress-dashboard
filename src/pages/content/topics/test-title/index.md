about: Child welfare programs are required to check the child abuse and neglect
  registry in each state that a potential foster parent has lived in during the
  past 5 years. This is called the “Adam Walsh check” after the 2006 act that
  requires it. Programs must also do this for anyone else in the home who’s 18
  years or older.
