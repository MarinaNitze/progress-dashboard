    about: To speed up the process and reduce application costs, offer ways for
      people to submit background check requests electronically. When people
      submit requests by mail, this leads to longer wait times and more
      opportunity for clerical mistakes.
    how: >-
      * Create a secure, generic email address for receiving requests instead of
      using an individual’s account. This provides a consistent process that
      won’t be disrupted by staff transition or vacation time.

      * Make your request form computer friendly. Turn your current form into a fillable PDF, Google form, or a standard Microsoft Word document. Paper forms have to be completed and scanned, creating additional barriers to submitting them — and then for reading them.

      * Provide an online portal for accepting background check requests the next time your agency updates the website.

    how: >-
      * Ask prospective foster families if they’ve lived out-of-state during
      your initial meeting with them — or even before, when you can.

      * Find the relevant Adam Walsh/out-of-state background check forms, either in your state or county’s Adam Walsh database or on the other state’s website.

      * Take a laptop to orientation for people interested in being foster parents and help them fill out online background check forms.

      * Take paper background check forms and make sure people understand how to fill them out.

      * If any of the background check forms require notarization, arrange for a volunteer notary to attend orientation and sign off on multiple forms at once.

    about: >-
      Social media is widely used across cultural, geographic, and economic
      groups. This makes social media a powerful and unique tool for finding
      family members of youth in foster care. 


      Other people-finding tools — like credit searches — have limited databases. For example, you have to have a credit history to appear in most of them.
    how: >-
      Search popular social media sites like Facebook for known family members,
      such as a youth’s parents or older siblings. From there, look through
      public messages, photos, and friend lists to identify additional
      connections and message them. 


      Before you start using social media for family finding, create a policy to guide staff. Cover topics like:


      * **Limiting accounts** — Provide official shared work accounts or have staff create  accounts that they only use for work. Don’t allow workers to use their personal accounts for family finding.  

      * **Confidentiality** — Don’t share private information through social media messages. Just as you would leave a generic voicemail when trying to identify kin, encourage social media contacts to reach out to you directly for follow-up.

      * **Respecting family privacy** — If a public child welfare account were to “friend” a possible family member, that would publicly reveal that the family member is having an interaction with child welfare. Workers should not update profiles, post public messages, or “friend” other accounts when using official work accounts for family finding. 

      * **Making staffing decisions** — Decide if a central team will conduct social media family finding activities, or if all workers will be granted access. There are pros and cons to both approaches.

      * **Unblocking social media sites** — Management may have to meet with IT to have certain social media sites unblocked from the network.

    title: ask-about-connections
    about: >-
      The beginning of foster care is a difficult and emotional time for
      children and their families. Both children and adults may be too stressed
      or afraid to share a complete list of connections during an initial
      meeting. 


      Reduce the risk that children will permanently lose important connections by checking in regularly about their networks. Different timing and questions often uncover more connections. And when children are in foster care for a while, they may also develop new relationships with people who can provide vital support. 


      Invite youth and the known adults in their lives — like birth parents, family, other kin, and even foster parents — multiple times to share a list of supportive connections.
    how: >-
      * Review the list of known connections at recurring planning meetings. Ask
      all participants if they can think of anyone who is missing.

      * Try different approaches for learning about connections, like: Who picks you up from school? Who would you call if you got locked out of your home? Who did you see at your last family gathering? Who do you miss?

        * **Ohio** is developing a new quality hearing court guide that includes prompting for the identification of missing supportive adults. It will guide the judge or magistrate to ask participants about whether relatives have been explored, pursued, and where they are in the process. It will also prompt courts to ask about kinship placement and whether the caregiver is linked with training, services and financial support.

        * **Rhode Island** connects with foster youth in group homes over Zoom meetings to ask about supportive connections.

      Ask youth, both at initial removal and at regular intervals afterwards, about the supportive adults in their lives. Even young children may be able to tell you about the important people in their lives.
    how: >-
      * Supervisors of child welfare workers can make it a practice to regularly
      ask, “What did the youth say?”

      * Ask youth about their supportive connections at every placement change, and at regular intervals — annually, for example.

      * Phrase inquiries carefully so that young people don’t feel like they have to supply a placement option or they will be homeless. Helpful prompts include: “Who came to your last family gathering?” and “Who would you call if you needed a ride home from school?”

      * Help youth stay connected to supportive adults, even when they’re not a placement option. Create opportunities for regular phone calls, visits, or other contact.

      When you connect with a youth’s kin, make it a point to always ask them if
      they know of other potential kin, whether they may be current connections
      to the child or family members that they haven’t yet met.


      Children can’t have too many adults who care about them. Most youth enter foster care with more connections than they leave with. Making sure to ask kin you know about to help identify additional kin, especially if children are too young to share on their own, can create a broader supportive network.
    how: >-
      * Make it a standard practice to ask kin about other kin during initial
      and ongoing kin contacts

      Effective family-finding requires a specialized skill set, from being
      savvy with social media to engaging newfound kin without scaring them. Not
      every case worker has these skills, and most already have demanding
      workloads. 


      A small team dedicated to finding family will help:


      * Free up case workers for other tasks

      * Test out promising new strategies and standardize effective practices 

      * Save money on subscription-based family-finding tools


      Form a dedicated family-finding team for your child welfare system, instead of relying on individual case workers to find kin for the children on their caseload.
    how: >-
      * Create a new team or department for family finding.

      * Charge this new team with specific tasks, like:

        * Using family-finding tools
        * Making initial contacts with potential kin
        * Establishing plans for staying in touch with kin
        * Searching for more kin at regular intervals
        * Prioritizing kin searches for children who are currently placed with non-kin
      * Put processes in place to ensure regular communication and collaboration across teams. Even with a dedicated team, finding kin is still everyone’s responsibility. Other case workers, planning meeting attendees, and young people are all resources for identifying and locating more kin.

      You can use a genogram tool like the ones we list below or simply a blank
      piece of paper or dry-erase board. Here are some tips:


      * Start making a family tree to show a child’s connections. 

      * Include all important connections, even if they aren’t legal or blood relatives.

      * Use the tree to generate new leads and to keep track of your contacts and progress.

      * [The Extreme Family Finding Project](https://www.fosteradopt.org/family-permanency/extreme-family-finding/) — which has a 95% success rate — recommends a genogram have at least 150-200 people on it.

    title: supportive-adults-have-robust presence
    about: Most youth leave foster care with fewer connections than they entered
      with. However, most supportive adults want to be more involved in
      supporting the youth in their lives. Keeping these adults engaged and
      involved in case planning can help keep youth from exiting care without
      connections. Invite at least three times as many supportive adults as paid
      staff members to planning meetings to maximize the benefits of this
      support network.
    how: >-
      * Redesign your planning meeting invitation - The invitation should serve
      as a prompt and remind staff to invite as many supportive adults as they
      can, ideally three times as many supportive adults as paid staff members. 

      * Redesign your meeting sign in sheet - Provide enough room for supportive adults to sign in for in-person meetings. For example, you might have four times as many lines in the “supportive adult” area than in the “staff” area. 

      * Ask youth about supportive adults in their lives - Staff should make sure that supportive adults are aware of and invited to planning meetings. You might even ask youth to suggest a supportive adult themselves. 

      * Keep track of meeting attendance - With a simple spreadsheet, you can keep track of the breakdown of roles at planning meetings. Use this information to keep track of progress towards the goal of having three times as many supportive adults as paid staff in attendance.

        simple Excel spreadsheet, with regular exports from their IT system.

        * **Ohio** has Youth Centered Permanency Round Tables (YCPRT) running in several counties. For YCPRTs, the youth is asked to bring a support person to the meeting. It can be anyone: a caregiver, a friend of the family, a member of the family, or anyone the youth feels is supportive of them. That can also initiate more conversations and discussion about permanency options and supports for the youth. One youth asked his fast food manager to come with him, and the manager didn’t even know he was in foster care. The manager ended up adopting him!

        * In **Ohio**, the practice for maintaining connections is: any youth 14 and over is able to have two support persons join in on the family team meetings and case plan meetings. That helps to initiate discussion of any other support persons available to the child.

      unrelated youth. By staying in a familiar setting, youth will experience
      fewer disruptions and will be able to better maintain their existing
      relationships. Using an expansive legal definition of kin will allow staff
      to find more placement options for youth more quickly. 


      Even if a connection cannot serve as a placement, youth need as many supportive adults around them as possible. Maintaining an expansive legal definition of kin will allow you to create a broader support system for youth.
    how: >-
      * When asking youth or supportive connections about placement options,
      make it clear that a kinship connection does not need to be a blood
      relation. You can also ask about family friends, teachers or the spouses
      of relatives. Some agencies consider these relationships to be “fictive
      kin.”

      * By asking about connections repeatedly over time, you can include important relationships that a youth has developed since entering care.

      * Some agencies will verify a relationship with a non-kin placement through conversations with the child, a parent or a third party such as a teacher or [clergy](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/foster-care/kinship-care).

      Foster parents may be reluctant to maintain a child’s previous connections, if they think doing so will harm their chances for adoption. However, even if the child is adopted, they deserve to have a strong support network. Making this a formal responsibility of foster parents can help keep a youth’s connections intact throughout their time in care.
    how: Revise your foster parent training to include the formal expectation that
      foster parents will help maintain a youth’s connections. For example, you

      consider making a genogram. After that, you should:


      * **Locate contact information for each supportive connection.** Staff may need to use social media to do so. 

      * **Make a formal plan to stay in touch with each connection.** Plans could include weekly Facetime or phone calls, exchanging letters or emails, in-person visits, providing transportation, or attending school events. You can even make a plan to stay in touch with a pet, such as visits to a dog park.

  - heading: Use a red team to prevent placements in group homes
    title: red-team-to-prevent-group-home-placements
    about: Fewer youth will enter group homes if there is a team dedicated to
      finding alternative placements. A red team should be a diverse group of
      agency staff, who conduct kin research, construct a genogram, and ask
      youth directly about possible placements. The team should be empowered to
      rapidly brainstorm, make decisions, and pursue alternatives to group home
      placements.
    how: >-
      * **Assemble a diverse team.** Strong team members will have a reputation
      for problem solving. Appoint a senior leader for the team. 

      * **Formally state the goal.** The goal of the red team is to find an alternative placement to group homes for every youth.

      * **Require a red team meeting before any youth can be placed in a group home.** You may require a meeting before additional scenarios, such as placing a youth out of state or placing a youth in a general foster home with other unrelated youth.

      * **Ask about connections.** As part of their process, the red team should construct a genogram and plan to ask youth about possible placement options.
    costs:
      - Staff time
    benefits:
      - Avoid placing children in general foster care or group homes who have
        kinship options
      - Staff may be able to increase initial kinship placements
      - Find more kin who can take placement and/or serve as supportive
        connections for youth
    outcome: "* **Rhode Island** has begun to depopulate group homes by requiring a
      red team before any group placement, or any placement into a home that
      already has at least one other unrelated foster child."
    who:

  - heading: Be gentle when interacting with kin for the first time
    title: be-gentle-when-interacting-with-kin-first-time
    about: >-
      Kinship connections may be permanently lost if an initial communication
      feels too overwhelming and demanding. Some connections may be learning
      they have a family member for the first time while simultaneously being
      asked to serve as a placement. Additionally, staff may feel that they need
      to move immediately to the next kin connection if an initial connection
      cannot serve as a placement. 


      However, engaging newfound kinship connections with gentler techniques from the start can help prevent losing important connections.
    how: >-
      * **Develop a list of guiding questions for staff to be used in initial
      conversations.** Staff should begin with smaller asks, especially if the
      kin is learning about a family member for the first time or has not been
      in touch for a long time. For example, staff may ask: “Do you have a
      family photo you can send?”

      * **Don’t limit initial conversations to placement discussions.**  Even if a placement option is urgently needed, youth need a long-term support network too. Overwhelming kinship connections risks losing those connections.

      * **Make sure that kin are aware of other ways to support youth.** If someone cannot serve as a placement option, they can still stay connected to a youth through visits or attending a planning meeting. Include as many kin as possible in your formal plans to stay connected.
    costs:
      - Revisions to workflow
      - Staff time
    benefits:
      - More supportive adults found and engaged in a youth’s life
      - Kin may eventually be able to serve as a placement option or supportive
        adult
    outcome: While we don’t have exact data for this recommendation, anecdotal data

    heading: Align checklists to statutes
    about: By aligning licensing checklist items to specific statutes, you can help
      decision-makers understand the source of these legal requirements. This
      ensures that decision-makers clearly understand the source of a problem,
      so they can identify the most effective solution. For example, a landline
      telephone requirement creates a challenge for many families as most people
      are now in mobile-only households. By highlighting the statute behind this
      requirement, a decision-maker can better consider whether it is enough to
      change the requirement, or if the policy behind the requirement needs to
      be updated and modernized as well.
    how: >-
      * Create or locate a list of all checklist items.

      * Identify the legal requirement for each item.

      * Add the statute number next to each item on the checklist. 

      * Consider how you might update items that are challenging to families. Can you update the requirement, or does the policy need to be changed?

  - heading: Give families a dedicated licensor
    title: give-families-a-dedicated-licensor
    about: >-
      Each part of the licensing process is often managed by different case
      workers. This has several negative effects, such as lengthening the
      process, increasing the likelihood of errors, and leaving each case worker
      with different pieces of information. 


      By dedicating a single case worker to the entire licensing process, you can increase high-touch engagement. The case worker will be able to get a more holistic and nuanced view of the family. It also increases family satisfaction, as they don’t get confused by multiple case workers.
    how: >-
      * Dedicating a single case worker to licensing will only add value if
      there are no more than 2-3 families per case worker. Look across your
      existing team and identify opportunities to expand the scope of some or
      all workers’ roles in exchange for smaller case loads. 

      * Consider restructuring teams that have highly-specialized roles within the licensing process to more generalized roles. This requires careful planning and cross-training. 

      * Pilot this effort with one or two workers who are interested in being dedicated licensors. Survey families they work with and families other team members work with to evaluate whether there is a meaningful difference in satisfaction, withdrawal rates, or licensing completion times. 

      * Providing adequate clerical support is still valuable in a team with dedicated licensors.
    costs:
      - Cost of restructuring teams and/or retraining staff
    benefits:
      - Increased family satisfaction
      - Increase family retention rates

    title: help-relative-placements-access-financial-assistance
    about: >-
      Sometimes, the biggest barrier to getting kinship families licensed is not
      safety concerns but financial requirements. Financial issues may be the
      only reason a relative placement doesn’t qualify. However, there are
      various programs that can provide assistance to these families and help
      them to get licensed. 


      Help relative placements access other financial assistance to meet the minimum licensing requirement. Better yet, you can waive financial requirements entirely for relative placements, recognizing that poverty should not keep families apart.
    how: >-
      * Connect relative placements to assistance upfront. Provide a list of
      benefits that families may qualify for or offer one-on-one application
      assistance. Examples of benefits include: TANF, SNAP, unemployment
      insurance, social security, and VA benefits. 

      * Customize the application assistance and instructions for your area, such as providing necessary translations. 

      * Conduct a parallel process and carry out the licensing process while families are still working to meet the financial requirements. You can complete many steps, like background checks and home study interviews, even if a family member is still working to access additional financial benefits. 

      * Waive the financial requirement for relative placements on a case-by-case basis. Many child welfare systems have an exemption process that allows licensors to bypass the financial requirements for a relative placement if the placement is in the best interests of the child. 

      * Make sure that an exemption process is well-documented and easy for new licensors to learn and follow. 

      * Set a policy eliminating financial requirements for relative placements. There are no minimum financial requirements set by the federal government for foster parents, only that “applicants must be financially stable to meet their family’s needs prior to placing a foster child in the home.” Your state can modify licensing requirements to eliminate asking relative placements for financial information. However, we still believe ensuring the financial stability of traditionally licensed foster homes is a good practice.
    costs:
      - Staff training time to learn new policies
      - Cost of providing application assistance

  - heading: License homes while social distancing
    title: license-homes-while-social-distancing
    about: >-
      Some child welfare systems have paused licensing for some or all new
      families in order to limit in-person contact, even though federal
      regulations do not require the licensing process to be conducted in
      person. Delays caused by stopping licensing can mean losing homes,
      especially relative placements, in a time when placement options are
      already severely limited. 


      Licensing new foster homes with minimal physical contact by conducting everything by email, phone, and video (except for fingerprinting and a single in-person safety walkthrough) can limit any delays and prevent the loss of placement options.
    how: >-
      * Conduct the initial safety walkthrough over video, during which case
      workers can identify safety concerns and make compliance plans. The final
      safety walkthrough can then be conducted in person, during a focused visit
      of no more than 20 minutes. 

      * For emergency relative placements, the in-person final safety walkthrough can be combined with the placement visit. Any follow-ups can be conducted over video. 

      * Conduct interviews over phone or video. If families lack technology equipment, connect them with [free Lifeline phone service](https://data.usac.org/publicreports/CompaniesNearMe/Download/Report) and [free Internet services](https://thinkofus.gitbook.io/command-center/resources/foster-youth/technology#i-cannot-afford-to-buy-access-to-the-internet). You may also be able to [use federal funding to secure equipment for families](https://thinkofusteam.app.box.com/s/joy9mrzgr4yjw997tjdi5dib1z6f1y4v).

      * Resolve minor pending items with photos.

      * Prioritize in-home and community-based fingerprinting. Mobile Livescan units reduce in-person time by allowing you to combine fingerprinting with the final safety walkthrough. Community-based fingerprinting sites like UPS stores remain open as essential businesses and provide a stress-free, fast environment for applicants to complete this requirement. 

      * Eliminate or temporarily suspend other in-person requirements. If your process requires a medical evaluation, allow a medical professional to complete the paperwork based on patients records or via a telehealth visit. 

      * Invest in online solutions that allow families to complete and track paperwork, attend and track orientations and trainings, and upload key documents. 

      * If your child welfare system has a unique requirement, like tuberculosis tests, evaluate whether such a unique requirement is necessary and remove or suspend it if possible.
    costs:
      - Software cost for online tracking system for families
      - Potential cost of mobile fingerprinting machine
    benefits:
      - "Limiting in-person contact while also limiting delays in licensing "

    title: offer-online-foster-parent-training
    about: >-
      Many agencies have paused their resource family training and licensing
      efforts during the pandemic. However, the need for safe placement options
      for foster children can’t afford to wait. 


      By offering online training and online or telephone recruitment and orientation events, you can continue to license families while limiting in-person contact.
    how: >-
      * Use an existing online foster parent training. The Caregiver Core
      Training (CCT) is an online system developed by the Alliance for Child
      Welfare Excellence in Washington State. You can view their training
      materials
      [here](https://allianceforchildwelfare.org/project/learn-more-about-caregiver-core-training-online).
      If you think this is a viable option for your child welfare agency, you
      can contact Christina Coad at the Alliance directly
      ([ccoad@uw.edu](mailto:ccoad@uw.edu)). 

      * Conduct telephone orientations. Washington, D.C. developed an approach for conducting orientation sessions over the phone which was well received by families who attended. The agency provided a PowerPoint [presentation](https://www.childwelfareplaybook.com/assets/CFSA_Recruitment_Orientation_March_2020_Pride.pptx) for attendees to follow along and had a foster parent on the line to offer a real-world perspective.

      * Conduct online orientations. You can use the same slide deck and materials as you would for an in-person orientation, or add an interactive element by using a platform like [Google Forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/) to create a [scored quiz](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/7032287?hl=en). If your agency uses [Binti](https://binti.com/), you can provide an online orientation video for families to watch. Afterwards, families can complete a quiz in order to get credit.

      * Convert your own in-person training to online training. If you prefer to use your own training instead of an existing online training, you can convert your materials. 

      * Follow promising practices for online training. In developing their own online training, Michigan identified several promising practices: 

        * Offer an online option for families to connect with one another. You can create a closed Facebook group for each class to help participants build connections and form a support group.
        * Schedule frequent classes. For two-parent households, this will allow parents to more easily switch between attending the training and spending time with children.
        * Keep classes short. A full-day class is often too long for many participants to do online. Build in short breaks throughout the class so that participants don’t disengage.
        * Set online meeting guidelines before the first class. Not all participants will be familiar with online meetings. Guidelines can include general expectations, online meeting manners (i.e. how to dress appropriately, when to mute), and instructions on using the technology. Leave time at the beginning of the meeting to assist with any technical difficulties.
        * Include an interactive element, such as a questionnaire for each session to make sure that parents understand the material as the trainer covers it. Cut any hands-on activities that can’t easily be done remotely. Instead, stop to discuss the material more often. 
        * Cap the class at approximately 20 people to make sure that everyone can engage. 
        * You can contact Jessica Sweet at Michigan DHHS if you have any questions ([SweetJ2@michigan.gov](mailto:SweetJ2@michigan.gov)).

    outcome: >-
      * Los Angeles County found that when given a choice, more than 90% of
      families (approximately 9,000 to date) opted to complete orientation
      online.

        * You can collect donated items in new condition during a “safety inspection” drive, similar to a backpack or canned food drive. Here is sample language for a safety inspection drive.
        * You can work with local partners like churches to host a drive event or a fundraiser. 
        * You can use Family Preservation Service dollars, an existing budgetary tool that can help acquire needed items when used for direct placement. 
      * **Distribute critical items.** Your goal should be to make it as easy as possible for your team to distribute critical safety items to families in need. To do so, keep a stash of essentials in easy-to-access locations like a designated supply closet or the trunk of a case worker’s car. You can also provide key items at a foster parent training or orientation.

    title: send-appointment-reminders
    about: >-
      Home study and inspection appointments are often scheduled for families
      without their input and with confirmation. As a result, families can miss
      critical appointments which delays the licensing process and creates
      unnecessary frustration. 


      Sending appointment reminders to families can help prevent these issues.
    how: You can send an appointment reminder to families via a shared calendar
      invite, physical mail, email or text. If possible, ask families what their
      preferred mode of communication is and send their reminder that way. Here
      are [text
      examples](https://www.childwelfareplaybook.com/assets/send_appointment_reminders_asset)
      for reminders in a variety of formats.
    costs:

    benefits:
      - Decreases the number of missed appointments
      - Decreases delays in the licensing process

    title: use-bilingual-staff-members-instead-of-interpreters
    about: >-
      Interpreters are highly skilled but they may not have child welfare
      specific knowledge. This can make it difficult to translate important
      content (especially on the fly) during foster parent orientation and
      training or in ongoing interactions. 


      Relying on bilingual staff members whenever possible will help ensure that families receive and understand important information and trainings.
    how: >-
      * Ask caregivers about the language they are most comfortable interacting
      in as early as possible, by including this on inquiry forms or at the very
      start of an application process. Case workers should identify whether a
      relative placement needs a translator right away. 

      * Maintain a list of bilingual staff members. Identify work flexibilities that can allow them to take on occasional training responsibilities even if their normal responsibilities are in a different part of the agency. 

      * Use remote meeting capabilities so that families and staff members can work together even if they are in different parts of your state.

      * County-administered systems can pool resources.

    title: allow-youth-to-explore-and-select-programs-available-to-them
    about: >-
      Many youth do not know what programs are available to them. Case workers
      are often managing so many cases that they don’t always have time to
      explain every available program. This means that youth may miss out on
      opportunities to prepare for independence. 


      Instead of requiring case workers to explain each program directly, make it possible for older youth to look through a list of available programming and choose the topics most relevant to them.
    how: >-
      Share a printed or emailed list of all programs with youth. Ask them to
      circle or highlight those that interest them. 


      You can also create a programming calendar online and allow youth to RSVP for programs of interest, using a free tool like Google Forms or Eventbrite.

      Many foster youth do not have reliable physical addresses, making it
      difficult for them to receive physical mail. In a multi-state discovery
      sprint with older foster youth, [Think of Us](https://thinkof-us.org/)
      found as many as 30% of mailed calendars were returned to sender. This
      means that as many as 30% of youth never learn about programs being
      offered.


      Switching from physical mail to using online calendars, email, and text messages to share information about programming and other materials will help ensure that youth do not miss important information.
    how: Programming calendars can be posted online and emailed to youth. You could
      also use an online calendar that allows others to subscribe to your
      events, like Eventbrite. A photo of the calendar could also be texted to
      youth.
    costs:

    about: >-
      In some places, youth in Extended Foster Care must travel to an in-person
      meeting each month to physically receive their EFC stipend. This can be
      very burdensome for youth who are also working or in college, and who may
      not have access to reliable transportation. During the pandemic, this left
      many youth without access to their stipends. 


      By using direct deposit to distribute extended foster care stipends, you can eliminate unnecessary barriers and ensure that youth receive their stipends reliably.
    how: Make it a practice to open a bank account for each youth as part of your
      onboarding process. This is the bank account you will use to direct
      deposit their stipends. You should be able to set up a direct deposit
      process through your existing accounting system.

    how: Create a list in Excel or your case management system where staff can
      easily view which youth are closest to aging out. In Excel, you can enter

      necessities. Giving cash or prepaid cards, instead of store-specific gift
      cards, is more useful and will go farther for youth purchasing groceries
      and other necessities. 


      In a multi-state discovery sprint with older foster youth, [Think of Us](https://www.thinkof-us.org/) found that when youth received Target gift cards, they often engaged in a complicated workaround: they purchased miscellaneous Target items, then returned them in batches to receive cash refunds in increments of $10. They then used that cash to buy food at other stores.
    how: >-

      * Use direct deposit to distribute youth stipends.

      * Send payment with a cash app like [Venmo](https://venmo.com/about/product/) or [Cashapp](https://cash.app/). Allow youth to choose the app they’d prefer to receive funds in. 

      * Give youth a prepaid cash card such as a [Visa gift card](https://usa.visa.com/pay-with-visa/find-card/get-prepaid-card), that can be used anywhere. Ensure that it has no transaction fees. 

      * Provide youth with a gift card of their choosing.

      entire year. In a multi-state discovery sprint with older foster youth,
      [Think of Us](https://www.thinkof-us.org/) found that when youth hear that
      foster care goes “until 21,” they believe that means “until their 22nd
      birthday,” when really it means that it ends on their 21st birthday.


      If a youth believes that they have an entire extra year in foster care, they may accidentally delay plans and activities that can prepare them for independence. Using precise language to describe the day that foster care ends will help avoid this confusion.
    how: Conduct an inventory of your program materials that reference the end of
      foster care (like posters, pamphlets, website content, and handouts).
      Replace any references to “until 21” with “to the end of 20” or “until
      your 21st birthday.” If your program ends at a different age, follow this
      same pattern.

    about: >-
      Use renewal as an opportunity to touch base with families about their
      current needs and goals. Families that are feeling overwhelmed might
      benefit from respite or taking lower-need children for a time, while
      families that are gaining experience may be ready to take on higher-need
      placement. 


      With foster homes in such high demand, it can be all too easy to keep making placements in a home until the family burns out and quits. Using renewal as an opportunity to check-in helps retain families longer. Additionally, it may not be obvious when a family is ready to take on more responsibility and train for higher-need placement. Renewal offers a natural opportunity for these conversations.
    how: >-
      Keep a spreadsheet or calendar of renewal dates. Before the license
      renewal process begins, schedule a check-in call with the family.
      Familiarize yourself with their current and recent placements prior to the
      call. 


      If a family has or recently had a stressful placement or disruption, consider options that might give them a break, including stepping down to take a lower-need placement, being placed on hold, or becoming a respite placement. 


      If a family has become more experienced and seems interested, use this conversation to talk to them about what a higher-need placement might look like and what trainings or experiences are available to them.

      wayside. Mailed reminders can be easily lost in the volume of other
      mailings received from a foster care agency (especially if your agency
      does not distinguish important mail). Most systems do not have an
      electronic portal for families to check their renewal status on their own,
      leaving families dependent on manual communications. 


      Send an email to foster families two to three months before their license expires, outlining the steps required for their renewal.
    how: >-
      * Maintain a spreadsheet of currently licensed families and their renewal
      dates. 

      * Write an email to a current foster family with an upcoming renewal and include every possible renewal requirement. Save this email as a template. 

      * When a family is 60 to 90 days out from their renewal date, send them this email. You can edit the requirement list to reflect their remaining steps as needed.

      renewal date is looming. In some systems, this means the only training
      available to them is reading books or watching movies, which does not
      maximally prepare caregivers for the needs of foster youth.


      Offer a curriculum of the highest-value trainings, with childcare and meals taken care of, to make completing training hours prior to renewal both simple for families and high-value for the agency.
    how: >-
      

      * Secure a venue for an all-day training event on a recurring basis at a time convenient for families, like one weekend a month. 

      * Survey parents, listen to questions at foster parent events, and speak with other case workers to identify the most-requested and most-needed trainings. 

      * Plan a day-long training curriculum around the highest-priority trainings for your community. 

      * Post the training online with clear instructions on how to sign up.

      * Notify families with license renewal dates in the next four to six months about the upcoming training dates. 

      * Secure childcare, provide lunch and snacks, and make transportation easy to access (i.e. by providing bus vouchers).

      By updating your recruitment materials, messaging, and inquiry forms, you can highlight the real needs of your child welfare agency: foster families who will prioritize helping to reunify and heal a child’s family of origin or provide permanency for older youth and sibling groups. Case workers should have multiple conversations about potential families’ expectations and work to clarify that fostering is not the right choice for a family that is only looking to adopt an infant.
    how: >-

    heading: Use Extreme Family Finding methods when necessary
    about: >-
      Child welfare systems have limited resources for family finding, and
      family may be unwilling to talk to government officials like Department
      staff. Extreme Family Finding puts a private investigator on the case of
      finding a child’s full family tree, some of whom may be more willing to
      talk to a detective. 


      Children who are selected for Extreme Family Finding can enter with as few as no connections, and a goal of creating a genogram of at least 125 adults. Extreme Family Finding also focuses on youth who are most at risk of aging out of care without permanency. While the primary goal for family finding is to find a permanent placement, this effort is also crucial for building up an entire supportive network for every youth.
    how: >-
      Initial Extreme Family Finding sites were funded by a grant from the
      Children’s Bureau, but even absent an official grant, you can recreate
      parts of the program by:


      * Building extensive genograms for every child in care, with the goal of filling in at least 30-80 connections.

      * Hiring a private investigator to find and talk to family connections for foster youth with few known connections.

      * Preserving known connections as soon as children enter care with heart maps and plans to stay connected to supportive adults.

    about: >-
      While separating duties can make your agency feel more efficient, being
      passed between staff members can be confusing and unpleasant for potential
      foster families, even causing them to back out of the process. Warm
      hand-offs and opportunities to stay connected with staff members with whom
      they have developed relationships can help keep potential foster families
      engaged and more likely to continue through the  licensing process. 


      Instead of passing off a potential foster family from a recruiter to a licensor, create more opportunities for warm hand-offs and for recruiting team members to continue seeing and interacting with their families.

      recruit families who do not best match the needs of youth in care.
      Including recruitment and placement workers in all of your routine

      families.
    how: >-
      * Hold monthly meetings to review youth who do not currently have
      placements or who have non-ideal placements (e.g. placed far away from
      their family of origin). Include case workers, placement workers, and
      recruiters. Ideally, include private agency representatives as well.

      Foster children often have to move schools or live with strangers who do
      not share their language or culture. Sometimes, a matching family is
      available for a child who otherwise does not have a strong match, but the
      placement team cannot see that family because they have not yet completed
      the application process. 


      Include families who have applied but not yet completed their license in your placement searches. When a child otherwise has no strong match, prioritize licensing a matching pending family.
    how: >-
      Include pending families in your placement searches. If there is a match,
      placement and licensing teams can work together to understand what steps
      must happen right away to license the family, and which steps might be
      able to wait until after placement. If the child does not have to move
      right away, arrange visits or other interactions with the matching family
      as they complete the licensing process. 


      In some jurisdictions, a judge can order a placement with a family that is not yet licensed but is otherwise a strong match for a child.

  - title: recruit-relative-caregivers-to-become-general-caregivers
    heading: Recruit relative caregivers to become general caregivers
    about: >-
      Every child welfare system is looking for more families. Kinship
      caregivers are often already full licensed (or have only minor steps
      remaining to become fully licensed), are familiar with the system, and may
      have fewer negative preconceived notions about foster children. Not every
      relative caregiver may be a good match for or even interested in taking in
      children who they do not know. But even converting a small percentage of
      relative caregivers to general licensed homes can make a big difference in
      the available pool of placement options. 


      Focus some recruitment efforts on existing relative caregivers. Make sure case workers discuss the idea of becoming a general licensed home with relative caregivers at regular points, particularly at permanency milestones like a return home. Your system should have a clear, documented path for “converting” from a relative caregiver to a general licensed home without having to start from scratch.
    how: >-
      

      * Encourage case workers to discuss the possibility of becoming a general foster home with kinship caregivers. Formally note when a relative caregiver has capacity for additional children in their home (even if they currently have only a child-specific license). 

      * When a placement search reveals no matching general caregivers, look to see if there are matching kinship caregivers. If your system prevents searching across both kinds of caregivers, consider reimagining this when it’s time to redo your CCWIS placements module.

If they see a relative caregiver may have extra capacity or after a kinship placement returns home, they initiate conversations about becoming a general foster home instead of closing. 

        * In Indiana, case workers are encouraged to discuss the possibility of taking on additional foster placements with relative caregivers on an individual basis. 

        * In Oklahoma, case workers are trained to discuss options with kinship caregivers. Through mixed training classes, relative caregivers are exposed to the idea of general foster care and can interact with general licensed families.

      * Review and update your recruitment and marketing materials (including websites, posters and brochures) to better reflect your community members. Prioritize the communities from which you need more homes in order to keep children within their community. For example, if you need more homes to support trans teenagers, make sure you include trans caregivers and LGBTQ+ positive stories in your materials. In addition to photographs, review materials for inclusive case studies and example scenarios. 

      * Ask for pronouns and preferred names in your inquiry and application forms, and use them. Make it routine for everyone to share pronouns when meeting prospective families, such as at orientation or training. You may need to use a legal name for formal background checks, but otherwise you should refer to individuals by their preferred names. 

      * Confirm that inquiry and application forms support household with single applicants, as well as households with two or three applicants, to support multi-generational households.

    how: Start a recognition program. Even a certificate and a personal note can go
      a long way towards making a foster family feel valued and appreciated (and
      all their friends will see the certificate on the wall). You can also
      commission local businesses to donate free or discounted items as awards

The squads build camaraderies and help one another through challenges. Each year, there is a competition to see which squad recruits the most new families, with a ceremony and gift card prizes for the winning squad. 

        * Frederick County, MD hosts regular events for current foster families (pivoting them to Google Meet during the pandemic). They have also recognized foster families through a variety of events and strategies including: an annual adults-only reception for foster families (with free, on-site childcare); a drive through celebration where foster families who drove by the office could pick up ready to heat catered meals; drive by caravans where case workers and foster families drive by houses with signs and music; recognition baskets for foster families that included fun items like board games, puzzles, and snacks; welcome baskets for new foster families that include the Department handbook, a water bottle, mugs, and books for both parents and children. 

        * Ohio uses billboards to recognize individual foster families. Some families take friends and picnics to visit their billboard!

    about: >-
      When filling out a foster family inquiry form, most people default to
      saying they heard about fostering “from the website” or “online.” However,
      further questioning reveals they were really exposed through an event at
      their church, a family connection, a radio commercial, or other
      experience. 


      By capturing detailed information about how new foster families were referred to your agency, you can focus on the highest-yield recruitment methods and avoid accidentally stopping methods that were, in fact, successfully recruiting families.
    how: >-
      

      * Add to your inquiry forms a list of possible events, marketing materials, or other recruitment methods that someone may have been exposed to, and ask which ones interested the person completing the inquiry. 

      * Make sure you have “Other” on your list as well, with a space to freely enter text. Encourage detail by labeling this field “Other (please be specific).

This helped them realize that ValPack mailers were actually reaching a lot of families. 

        * Fairfax County, VA does not ask for referral information on its inquiry form, instead asking in the initial orientation phone call. They report that this provides richer and more detailed answers than a form. For instance, if a family says they heard about fostering on their website, staff can ask how they go to the website or if there was something in particular that caught their attention.

      Just because a family is not ready to foster today does not mean that they
      couldn’t be a strong placement option in the future. New data shows that
      it can take some families years between when they first take an interest
      in fostering and when they start an application. When systems delete or
      close out inquiries to meet short-term metrics like conversion rates, they
      also potentially lose out on a number of families who would have completed
      applications in the future. 


      Keep all your potential foster family inquiries open and find ways to keep families engaged with newsletters, email campaigns, and the occasional personal check-in. You can also keep interested families engaged by highlighting other ways for them to support foster youth, such as participating in a donation drive or volunteering at an event.
    how: >-
      

      * If your team maintains performance metrics around converting inquiries to applications, stop.

      * Identify ways to keep in touch with long-standing inquiries without taking up a lot of staff time, such as creating an automated email newsletter. 

      * Have a clear policy about what steps a family has to retake, and in what timeframe, if they begin part of the process but aren’t ready to complete it.

Many families take a long time to complete the application: more families take six or more months than the number of families who complete the application right away.

        * Fairfax County, VA keeps all inquiries open. They report that families can take an average of two to three years to move from an inquiry to an application.

      Becoming a foster parent is a big step, and many potential foster parents
      need more human interaction to reassure them through the process. Call or
      meet with potential foster families when they submit an inquiry, instead
      of relying on automated emails and mailings. Speaking with potential
      families can help clarify expectations and get potential caregivers
      comfortable with moving to the next step. 


      Additionally, when there’s too much automation upfront, families for whom fostering is not a good fit can get far into the process before they have an opportunity to talk with a real person. By speaking with potential families early, you can help dissuade families for whom fostering is not a good fit (e.g. families only interested in adopting infants), so your agency can focus on the families that best meet the needs of your current youth.
    how: Look for opportunities to include a human interaction, such as a phone
      call, early in the inquiry process. If you don’t have the staff resources
      for this, consider hiring current foster parents to help.

    about: >-
      Filling out a form indicating interest in becoming a foster parent is a
      big step. When someone fills out an inquiry form, they might be ready to
      go right away, or they might need time and more information to think about
      making such a significant commitment. If too much time passes before they
      get a response, a potential caregiver may become discouraged, second guess
      themselves, or change their mind. 


      Set a required, short response time for following up with potential foster family inquiries. Responding quickly with more information makes you seem responsive and supportive to new families, gives primed applicants a way to get started and make a more informed choice about whether fostering is right for them, and can help weed out poor fits (e.g. families only looking to adopt infants). By providing information about additional ways to support foster youth, you can also help more hesitant families get and stay engaged.
    how: >-
      

      * Set a metric, ranging from one to seven days, for how quickly you will respond to new inquiries. This metric should be as short as possible, but realistic given your current staffing and resources. Track initial response times for new inquiries. If they begin to slip, work with your team to identify how to respond faster (such as increasing resources or using calendar reminders). 

      * Create an automated email with links to information on fostering. Consider adding tips for ways to support foster youth without becoming a foster parent. Provide a printed version for families who do not use email. 

      * Create a newsletter (email and/or print) to keep interested families engaged.

      * Create a calendar with reminders to check in with potential foster families. You can also use a task management app with date-based reminders to keep track of which families you need to check in with and when. Ideally, the entire team will share visibility across these lists, so if someone is out sick then another team member can cover their check-in calls.

      meet the certain characteristics your foster children most need, such as
      caregivers who speak particular languages or work in a specific
      profession. 


      Leveraging targeted digital marketing campaigns, alongside your other recruitment methods, can be more successful at finding these families than more generic campaigns.
    how: Work with a digital marketing expert to design your first campaign.
      Together, you can determine what kind(s) of caregivers you’d like to
      recruit; what collateral (e.g. email content, website landing page) you’ll
      need to create; and what the right budget is. Online advertisements do
      cost money, but can have a higher return on investment than some analog
      recruitment methods.

    heading: Require senior staff sign-off for non-relative placements
    about: Case workers don’t want to wake a director in the middle of the night to
      sign-off on a non-relative placement. Requiring this level of sign-off
      incentivizes early family finding and may prevent placements in group
      homes.
    how: Require senior staff sign-off for non-relative placements, no matter the
      time of day. You can require sign-off on initial placements, subsequent
      placements, and any congregate care placements.
    costs:
      - Free
    benefits:
      - Incentivizes finding more kinship placement options
      - Helps prevent placement in group homes
    outcome: New Mexico increased initial kinship placements from 3% to 40% in one
      year by shifting to practices that included requiring Director-level
      approval for non-kin placements.
    who:
      number: 1
      what: "* New Mexico has a policy that a Director must sign-off on any placement
        with non-kin, whether general foster care or a group home, even if it’s
        the middle of the night."

    heading: Use a Heart Map to identify a youth’s important relationships
    about: >-
      Many foster youth enter care with more connections than they leave with.
      If a supportive adult is not an immediate placement option, they are
      usually not tracked meaningfully by the system. But even if a contact does
      not serve as a placement option, they can still be an important part of a
      youth’s supportive network. 


      The Heart Map exercise provides a meaningful way for staff to surface contacts with youth, in order to strengthen and maintain those relationships.
    how: >-
      

      * Download a printable [Heart Map](https://www.childwelfareplaybook.com/assets/heartmap.pdf). As soon as a youth enters care, walk them through the Heart Map to quickly surface people who are important to them. 

      * Encourage youth to list “someone in their heart” on each line, and draw more lines as needed. The two existing lines on the heart are strategic: More than one line prompts thinking about multiple relationships, but too many lines can be disheartening if youth cannot fill them all in. 

      * Make an action plan to set up visits, phone calls, social media, and/or other continuing connections with each identified contact. Share the action plan with a youth’s entire team, including their foster parents, so everyone can help achieve it.
