      - Costs to create a fillable PDF or electronic form
    inspiration: "**[Ohio's electronic portal for background check
      requests](https://jfs.ohio.gov/ocf/childprotectiveservices.stm)**"
    about: "**To speed up the process and reduce application costs, offer ways for
      people to submit background check requests electronically. When people
      submit requests by mail, this leads to longer wait times and more
      opportunity for clerical mistakes.**"
    how: >-
      * Create a secure, generic email address for receiving requests instead of
      using an individual’s account. This provides a consistent process that
      won’t be disrupted by staff transition or vacation time.

      * Make your request form computer friendly. Turn your current form into a fillable PDF, Google form, or a standard Microsoft Word document. Paper forms have to be completed and scanned, creating additional barriers to submitting them — and then for reading them.

      * Provide an online portal for accepting background check requests the next time your agency updates the website.

  - heading: Complete background check forms to orientation
    costs:
      - Staff time at orientation
    inspiration: ""
    about: "**The process and timeframe for out-of-state abuse and neglect registry
      checks — commonly called Adam Walsh checks — vary quite a bit from state
      to state. To get foster families approved faster, start out-of-state
      background checks early.**"
    how: >-
      * Ask prospective foster families if they’ve lived out-of-state during
      your initial meeting with them — or even before, when you can.

      * Find the relevant Adam Walsh/out-of-state background check forms, either in your state or county’s Adam Walsh database or on the other state’s website.

      * Take a laptop to orientation for people interested in being foster parents and help them fill out online background check forms.

      * Take paper background check forms and make sure people understand how to fill them out.

      * If any of the background check forms require notarization, arrange for a volunteer notary to attend orientation and sign off on multiple forms at once.
    outcome: "**We’re still collecting concrete data. But we believe that this will
      shorten the time it takes to approve foster families who’ve lived out of
      state.**"

    costs:
      - Social media training
      - Employee time

      checklist](http://www.michigan.gov/documents/dhs/DHS-0991_480683_7.dot)**"
    about: >-
      Social media is widely used across cultural, geographic, and economic
      groups. This makes social media a powerful and unique tool for finding
      family members of youth in foster care. 


      Other people-finding tools — like credit searches — have limited databases. For example, you have to have a credit history to appear in most of them.
    how: >-
      Search popular social media sites like Facebook for known family members,
      such as a youth’s parents or older siblings. From there, look through
      public messages, photos, and friend lists to identify additional
      connections and message them. 


      Before you start using social media for family finding, create a policy to guide staff. Cover topics like:


      * **Limiting accounts** — Provide official shared work accounts or have staff create  accounts that they only use for work. Don’t allow workers to use their personal accounts for family finding.  

      * **Confidentiality** — Don’t share private information through social media messages. Just as you would leave a generic voicemail when trying to identify kin, encourage social media contacts to reach out to you directly for follow-up.

      * **Respecting family privacy** — If a public child welfare account were to “friend” a possible family member, that would publicly reveal that the family member is having an interaction with child welfare. Workers should not update profiles, post public messages, or “friend” other accounts when using official work accounts for family finding. 

      * **Making staffing decisions** — Decide if a central team will conduct social media family finding activities, or if all workers will be granted access. There are pros and cons to both approaches.

      * **Unblocking social media sites** — Management may have to meet with IT to have certain social media sites unblocked from the network.
    outcome: "**New Mexico increased initial kinship placements from 3% to 40% in
      one year by shifting to practices that included using social media to
      identify kin.**"
    title: use-social-media
    benefits:
      - Find more kin who can take placement and/or serve as lifelong support
        for vulnerable youth
      - Find some kin your agency would not otherwise find
      - Avoid placing children in general foster care who have kinship placement
