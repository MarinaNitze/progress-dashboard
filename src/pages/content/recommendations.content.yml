  - heading: Accept background check electronically
    costs:
      - Costs to create a fillable PDF or electronic form
    inspiration: "**[Ohio's electronic portal for background check
      requests](https://jfs.ohio.gov/ocf/childprotectiveservices.stm)**"
    about: "**To speed up the process and reduce application costs, offer ways for
      people to submit background check requests electronically. When people
      submit requests by mail, this leads to longer wait times and more
      opportunity for clerical mistakes.**"
    how: >-
      * Create a secure, generic email address for receiving requests instead of
      using an individual’s account. This provides a consistent process that
      won’t be disrupted by staff transition or vacation time.

      * Make your request form computer friendly. Turn your current form into a fillable PDF, Google form, or a standard Microsoft Word document. Paper forms have to be completed and scanned, creating additional barriers to submitting them — and then for reading them.

      * Provide an online portal for accepting background check requests the next time your agency updates the website.

  - heading: Complete background check forms to orientation
    costs:
      - Staff time at orientation
    inspiration: ""
    about: "**The process and timeframe for out-of-state abuse and neglect registry
      checks — commonly called Adam Walsh checks — vary quite a bit from state
      to state. To get foster families approved faster, start out-of-state
      background checks early.**"
    how: >-
      * Ask prospective foster families if they’ve lived out-of-state during
      your initial meeting with them — or even before, when you can.

      * Find the relevant Adam Walsh/out-of-state background check forms, either in your state or county’s Adam Walsh database or on the other state’s website.

      * Take a laptop to orientation for people interested in being foster parents and help them fill out online background check forms.

      * Take paper background check forms and make sure people understand how to fill them out.

      * If any of the background check forms require notarization, arrange for a volunteer notary to attend orientation and sign off on multiple forms at once.
    outcome: "**We’re still collecting concrete data. But we believe that this will
      shorten the time it takes to approve foster families who’ve lived out of
      state.**"
