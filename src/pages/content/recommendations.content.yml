    about: To speed up the process and reduce application costs, offer ways for
      people to submit background check requests electronically. Requests through physical mail lead to longer wait times and more
      opportunity for clerical mistakes.
    how: >-
      * Create a secure, generic email address for receiving requests instead of
      using an individual’s account. This provides a consistent process that
      won’t be disrupted by staff transition or vacation time.

      * Make your request form computer-friendly. Turn your current form into a fillable PDF, Web form, or a standard Microsoft Word document. Paper forms have to be completed and scanned, creating additional barriers to submitting them — and then for reading them.

      * Provide an online portal for accepting background check requests as part of any future system modernization efforts.

    about: >-
      Social media is widely used across cultural, geographic, and economic
      groups. This makes social media a powerful and unique tool for finding
      family members of youth in foster care. 


      Other people-finding tools — like credit searches — have limited databases. For example, you have to have a credit history to appear in most of them, entirely missing kin with thin or non-existent credit files.
    how: >-
      Search popular social media sites like Facebook for known family members,
      such as a youth’s parents or older siblings. From there, look through
      public messages, photos, and friend lists to identify additional
      connections and message them. (This message should not reveal identifying details.) 


      Child welfare systems should _require_ social media searches as a core part of kin finding activities. 


      Make sure to have a [robust social media](/recommendations/social-media-policy) policy in place.

  - heading: Ask about connections repeatedly over time
    title: ask-about-connections
    about: >-
      The beginning of foster care is a difficult and emotional time for
      children and their families. Both children and adults may be too stressed
      or afraid to share a complete list of connections during an initial
      meeting. 


      Reduce the risk that children will permanently lose important connections by checking in regularly about their networks. Different timing and questions often uncover more connections. And when children are in foster care for a while, they may also develop new relationships with people who can provide vital support. 


      Invite youth and the known adults in their lives — like parents, family, other kin, and even foster parents — multiple times to share a list of supportive connections.
    how: >-
      * Review the list of known connections at recurring planning meetings. Ask
      all participants if they can think of anyone who is missing.

      * Set and require specific milestones for repeating kin-finding activities, such as court hearings, planning meetings, or at specific calendar intervals. Specify exactly who is responsible for leading this work at each milestone.

      * Try different approaches for learning about connections, like: Who picks you up from school? Who would you call if you got locked out of your home? Who did you see at your last family gathering? Who do you miss?

        * **Ohio** is developing a new quality hearing court guide that includes prompting for the identification of missing supportive adults. It will guide the judge or magistrate to ask participants about whether relatives have been explored, pursued, and where they are in the process. It will also prompt courts to ask about kinship placement and whether the caregiver is linked with training, services and financial support.

        * **Rhode Island** connects with foster youth in group homes over Zoom meetings to ask about supportive connections.

      have placement options with adults they already know and trust.


      Ask youth, both at initial removal and at regular intervals afterwards, about the supportive adults in their lives. Even young children may be able to tell you about the important people in their lives.
    how: >-
      * Require workers to talk to youth about their connections, no matter how young. Supervisors can encourage this practice by regularly
      asking, “What did the youth say?”

      * Use [heart maps](/recommendation/use-heart-map) with youth to learn more about their supportive adults.

      * Ask youth about their supportive connections at every placement change, and at regular intervals — annually, for example.

      * Designate an official place for keeping a youth's list of kin in your IT system.

      * Phrase inquiries carefully so that young people don’t feel like they have to supply a placement option or they will be homeless. Helpful prompts include: “Who came to your last family gathering?” and “Who would you call if you needed a ride home from school?”

      * Help youth stay connected to supportive adults, even when they’re not a placement option. Create opportunities for regular phone calls, visits, or other contact.

      When you connect with a youth’s kin, make it a point to always ask them if
      they know of other potential kin, whether they may be current connections
      to the child or family members that they haven’t yet met.


      Children can’t have too many adults who care about them. Most youth enter foster care with more connections than they leave with. Making sure to ask kin you know about to help identify additional kin, especially if children are too young to share on their own, can create a broader supportive network.
    how: >-
      * Require team members to ask kin about other kin during initial
      and ongoing kin contacts.

      * Designate a place in your IT system for storing information about all kin, including names and contact information.

      * Add a question like, “Are there other connections that we should know about?” to any kinship-finding form letters or standard messages.

    about: >-
      Effective family-finding requires a specialized skill set, from being
      savvy with social media to engaging newfound kin without scaring them. Not
      every case worker has these skills, and most already have demanding
      workloads. 


      A small team dedicated to finding family will help:


      * Free up case workers for other tasks

      * Test out promising new strategies and standardize effective practices 

      * Save money on subscription-based family-finding tools


      Form a dedicated family-finding team for your child welfare system, instead of relying on individual case workers to find kin for the children on their caseload.
    how: >-
      * Create a new team or department for family finding.

      * Charge this new team with specific tasks, like:

        * Using family-finding tools
        * Making initial contacts with potential kin
        * Establishing plans for staying in touch with kin
        * Searching for more kin at regular intervals
        * Prioritizing kin searches for children who are currently placed with non-kin
      * Put processes in place to ensure regular communication and collaboration across teams. Even with a dedicated team, finding kin is still everyone’s responsibility. Other case workers, planning meeting attendees, and young people are all resources for identifying and locating more kin.

      genogram offers a helpful, visual solution. By organizing existing
      contacts using a genogram, you can see key relationships easily and start
      identifying possible additions.
    how: >-
      You can use a genogram tool like the ones we list below or simply a blank
      piece of paper or dry-erase board. Here are some tips:


      * Start making a family tree to show a child’s connections. 

      * Include all important connections, even if they aren’t legal or blood relatives.

      * Use the tree to generate new leads and to keep track of your contacts and progress.

      * [The Extreme Family Finding Project](https://www.fosteradopt.org/family-permanency/extreme-family-finding/) — which has a 95% success rate — recommends a genogram have at least 150-200 people on it.

  - heading: Make sure supportive adults have a robust presence at planning meetings
    title: supportive-adults-have-robust-presence
    about: Most youth leave foster care with fewer connections than they entered
      with. However, most supportive adults want to be more involved in
      supporting the youth in their lives. Keeping these adults engaged and
      involved in case planning can help keep youth from exiting care without
      connections. Invite at least three times as many supportive adults as paid
      staff members to planning meetings to maximize the benefits of this
      support network.
    how: >-
      * Redesign your planning meeting invitation - The invitation should serve
      as a prompt and remind staff to invite as many supportive adults as they
      can, ideally three times as many supportive adults as paid staff members. 

      * Redesign your meeting sign in sheet - Provide enough room for supportive adults to sign in for in-person meetings. For example, you might have four times as many lines in the “supportive adult” area than in the “staff” area. 

      * Ask youth about supportive adults in their lives - Staff should make sure that supportive adults are aware of and invited to planning meetings. You might even ask youth to suggest a supportive adult themselves. 

      * Keep track of meeting attendance - With a simple spreadsheet, you can keep track of the breakdown of roles at planning meetings. Use this information to keep track of progress towards the goal of having three times as many supportive adults as paid staff in attendance.
      * Keep asking about supportive adults as new goals arise - A youth may have one or more supportive adults who generally attend meetings, but may have an additional support for a specific goal, such as practicing for a driving test, getting mentoring in math, or shopping for a prom dress.
    costs:

        simple Excel spreadsheet, with regular exports from their IT system.

        * **Ohio** has Youth Centered Permanency Round Tables (YCPRT) running in several counties. For YCPRTs, the youth is asked to bring a support person to the meeting. It can be anyone: a caregiver, a friend of the family, a member of the family, or anyone the youth feels is supportive of them. That can also initiate more conversations and discussion about permanency options and supports for the youth. One youth asked his fast food manager to come with him, and the manager didn’t even know he was in foster care. The manager ended up adopting him!

        * In **Ohio**, the practice for maintaining connections is: any youth 14 and over is able to have two support persons join in on the family team meetings and case plan meetings. That helps to initiate discussion of any other support persons available to the child.
        * **Hawaii** develops [Youth Circles](/assets/HawaiiCircleBrochure.pdf) for each child, which includes working with each youth to identify the supportive adults who will be invited to the circle. 

        * **New Hampshire** identifies up to 45 of a youth's supports through Permanency Pact through Foster Club, and involves them in meetings to accomplish specific goals, such as buying a first car, attending holiday celebrations after aging out of care, etc. As adults are identified, the agency sends those adults invites and supportive materials to support these goals.

      Being placed in kinship care can often be a more stable placement for
      youth when compared to placement in a group home or foster home with other
      unrelated youth. By staying in a familiar setting, youth will experience
      fewer disruptions and will be able to better maintain their existing
      relationships. Using an expansive legal definition of kin will allow staff
      to find more placement options for youth more quickly, and can mean more adults qualify to be emergency placements. 


      Even if a connection cannot serve as a placement, youth need as many supportive adults around them as possible. Maintaining an expansive legal definition of kin will allow you to create a broader support system for youth.
    how: >-
      * When asking youth or supportive connections about placement options,
      remove any requirements that kin needs to be a blood or legal 
      relation. You can also ask about family friends, teachers or the spouses
      of relatives. Some agencies consider these relationships to be “fictive
      kin,” though this term has fallen out of use.

      * By asking about connections repeatedly over time, you can include important relationships that a youth has developed since entering care, too.

      * Some agencies find more kin through conversations with the child, a parent, or a third party such as a teacher or [clergy](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/foster-care/kinship-care).

      that part of their formal responsibility is to help the youth in their
      care keep in touch with the supportive connections in their lives. 


      Foster parents may be reluctant to maintain a child’s previous connections, if they think doing so will harm their chances for adoption. However, even if the child is adopted, they deserve to have a strong support network. Making this a formal responsibility of foster parents can help keep a youth’s connections intact throughout their time in care.
    how:
      Revise your foster parent training to include the formal expectation that
      foster parents will help maintain a youth’s connections. For example, you

    how: >-
      As soon as the youth enters care, make a list of all the supportive
      connections in their lives, including family members, teachers, friends,
      and even pets. Work with the youth to create this list. 
      Consider making a genogram or heart map. After that, you should:


      * **Locate contact information for each supportive connection.** Staff may need to use social media to do so. 

      * **Make a formal plan to stay in touch with each connection.** Plans could include weekly Facetime or phone calls, exchanging letters or emails, in-person visits, providing transportation, or attending school events. You can even make a plan to stay in touch with a pet, such as visits to a dog park. 

      * **Designate a place in your IT system to store these plans.**

        * [**California** State Code](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=WIC&sectionNum=16501.1) requires that the child welfare system make a plan for maintaining supportive connections for foster youth 10 and older.
  - heading: Use a red team to prevent placements in group homes
    title: red-team-to-prevent-group-home-placements
    about: Fewer youth will enter group homes if there is a team dedicated to
      finding alternative placements. A red team should be a diverse group of
      agency staff, who conduct kin research, construct a genogram, and ask
      youth directly about possible placements. The team should be empowered to
      rapidly brainstorm, make decisions, and pursue alternatives to group home
      placements.
    how: >-
      * **Assemble a diverse team.** Strong team members will have a reputation
      for problem solving. Appoint a senior leader for the team. 

      * **Formally state the goal.** The goal of the red team is to find an alternative placement to group homes for every youth.

      * **Require a red team meeting before any youth can be placed in a group home.** You may require a meeting before additional scenarios, such as placing a youth out of state or placing a youth in a general foster home with other unrelated youth.

      * **Ask about connections.** As part of their process, the red team should construct a genogram and plan to ask youth about possible placement options.
    costs:
      - Staff time
    benefits:
      - Avoid placing children in general foster care or group homes who have
        kinship options
      - Staff may be able to increase initial kinship placements
      - Find more kin who can take placement and/or serve as supportive
        connections for youth
    outcome:
      '* **Rhode Island** has begun to depopulate group homes by requiring a

  - heading: Be gentle when interacting with kin for the first time
    title: be-gentle-when-interacting-with-kin-first-time
    about: >-
      Kinship connections may be permanently lost if an initial communication
      feels too overwhelming and demanding. Some connections may be learning
      they have a family member for the first time while simultaneously being
      asked to serve as a placement. Additionally, staff may feel that they need
      to move immediately to the next kin connection if an initial connection
      cannot serve as a placement. 


      However, engaging newfound kinship connections with gentler techniques from the start can help prevent losing important connections.
    how: >-
      * **Develop a list of guiding questions for staff to be used in initial
      conversations.** Staff should begin with smaller asks, especially if the
      kin is learning about a family member for the first time or has not been
      in touch for a long time. For example, staff may ask: “Do you have a
      family photo you can send?”

      * **Don’t limit initial conversations to placement discussions.**  Even if a placement option is urgently needed, youth need a long-term support network too. Overwhelming kinship connections risks losing those connections.

      * **Make sure that kin are aware of other ways to support youth.** If someone cannot serve as a placement option, they can still stay connected to a youth through visits or attending a planning meeting. Include as many kin as possible in your formal plans to stay connected.
    costs:
      - Revisions to workflow
      - Staff time
    benefits:
      - More supportive adults found and engaged in a youth’s life
      - Kin may eventually be able to serve as a placement option or supportive
        adult
    outcome:
      While we don’t have exact data for this recommendation, anecdotal data
      from our members suggests that many kin who aren’t placements on day one
      eventually serve as placements and/or supportive connections later on.

    heading: Align checklists to statutes
    about:
      By aligning licensing checklist items to specific statutes, you can help
      decision-makers understand the source of these legal requirements. This
      ensures that decision-makers clearly understand the source of a problem,
      so they can identify the most effective solution. For example, a landline
      telephone requirement creates a challenge for many families as most people
      are now in mobile-only households. By highlighting the statute behind this
      requirement, a decision-maker can better consider whether it is enough to
      change the requirement, or if the policy behind the requirement needs to
      be updated and modernized as well.
    how: >-
      * Create or locate a list of all checklist items.

      * Identify the legal requirement for each item.

      * Add the statute number next to each item on the checklist. 

      * Consider how you might update items that are challenging to families. Can you update the requirement, or does the policy need to be changed?

      Case workers spend a significant amount of time on licensing paperwork,
      which is time they could otherwise spend directly with families or on
      evaluations. By providing clerical support for case workers, you can
      reduce the amount of paperwork that case workers are responsible for.
    how: >-
      Hire one or more clerical workers (depending on the size of your office).
      You may be able to leverage clerical staff in another department or
      convert an existing position. 


      A clerical worker can send and receive physical mail and email, keep track of paperwork requirements for each family, track renewal requirements, send appointment reminders, track background check paperwork, and handle other clerical responsibilities.
    costs:

  - heading: Give families a dedicated licensor
    title: give-families-a-dedicated-licensor
    about: >-
      Each part of the licensing process is often managed by different case
      workers. This has several negative effects, such as lengthening the
      process, increasing the likelihood of errors, and leaving each case worker
      with different pieces of information. 


      By dedicating a single case worker to the entire licensing process, you can increase high-touch engagement. The case worker will be able to get a more holistic and nuanced view of the family. It also increases family satisfaction, as they don’t get confused by multiple case workers.
    how: >-
      * Dedicating a single case worker to licensing will only add value if
      there are no more than 2-3 families per case worker. Look across your
      existing team and identify opportunities to expand the scope of some or
      all workers’ roles in exchange for smaller case loads. 

      * Consider restructuring teams that have highly-specialized roles within the licensing process to more generalized roles. This requires careful planning and cross-training. 

      * Pilot this effort with one or two workers who are interested in being dedicated licensors. Survey families they work with and families other team members work with to evaluate whether there is a meaningful difference in satisfaction, withdrawal rates, or licensing completion times. 

      * Providing adequate clerical support is still valuable in a team with dedicated licensors.
    costs:
      - Cost of restructuring teams and/or retraining staff
    benefits:
      - Increased family satisfaction
      - Increase family retention rates

      Put a sticker or colored circle on critical mail, such as renewal letters.
      Communicate with families early on that they need to open and respond to
      any mail with this particular marking. 


      Choose your priority mail wisely. If you put a sticker on every envelope, this technique will stop being effective.

    title: help-relative-placements-access-financial-assistance
    about: >-
      Sometimes, the biggest barrier to getting kinship families licensed is not
      safety concerns but financial requirements. Financial issues may be the
      only reason a relative placement doesn’t qualify. However, there are
      various programs that can provide assistance to these families and help
      them to get licensed. 


      Help relative placements access other financial assistance to meet the minimum licensing requirement. Better yet, you can waive financial requirements entirely for relative placements, recognizing that poverty should not keep families apart.
    how: >-
      * Connect relative placements to assistance upfront. Provide a list of
      benefits that families may qualify for or offer one-on-one application
      assistance. Examples of benefits include: TANF, SNAP, unemployment
      insurance, social security, and VA benefits. 

      * Customize the application assistance and instructions for your area, such as providing necessary translations. 

      * Conduct a parallel process and carry out the licensing process while families are still working to meet the financial requirements. You can complete many steps, like background checks and home study interviews, even if a family member is still working to access additional financial benefits. 

      * Waive the financial requirement for relative placements on a case-by-case basis. Many child welfare systems have an exemption process that allows licensors to bypass the financial requirements for a relative placement if the placement is in the best interests of the child. 

      * Make sure that an exemption process is well-documented and easy for new licensors to learn and follow. 

      * Set a policy eliminating financial requirements for relative placements. There are no minimum financial requirements set by the federal government for foster parents, only that “applicants must be financially stable to meet their family’s needs prior to placing a foster child in the home.” Your state can modify licensing requirements to eliminate asking relative placements for financial information. However, we still believe ensuring the financial stability of traditionally licensed foster homes is a good practice.
    costs:
      - Staff training time to learn new policies
      - Cost of providing application assistance
    benefits:
      - Increases the number of licensed relative placements
      - Increases the financial stability of relative placements by providing
        access to other financial benefits

  - heading: License homes while social distancing
    title: license-homes-while-social-distancing
    about: >-
      Some child welfare systems have paused licensing for some or all new
      families in order to limit in-person contact, even though federal
      regulations do not require the licensing process to be conducted in
      person. Delays caused by stopping licensing can mean losing homes,
      especially relative placements, in a time when placement options are
      already severely limited. 


      Licensing new foster homes with minimal physical contact by conducting everything by email, phone, and video (except for fingerprinting and a single in-person safety walkthrough) can limit any delays and prevent the loss of placement options.
    how: >-
      * Conduct the initial safety walkthrough over video, during which case
      workers can identify safety concerns and make compliance plans. The final
      safety walkthrough can then be conducted in person, during a focused visit
      of no more than 20 minutes. 

      * For emergency relative placements, the in-person final safety walkthrough can be combined with the placement visit. Any follow-ups can be conducted over video. 

      * Conduct interviews over phone or video. If families lack technology equipment, connect them with [free Lifeline phone service](https://data.usac.org/publicreports/CompaniesNearMe/Download/Report) and [free Internet services](https://thinkofus.gitbook.io/command-center/resources/foster-youth/technology#i-cannot-afford-to-buy-access-to-the-internet). You may also be able to [use federal funding to secure equipment for families](https://thinkofusteam.app.box.com/s/joy9mrzgr4yjw997tjdi5dib1z6f1y4v).

      * Resolve minor pending items with photos.

      * Prioritize in-home and community-based fingerprinting. Mobile Livescan units reduce in-person time by allowing you to combine fingerprinting with the final safety walkthrough. Community-based fingerprinting sites like UPS stores remain open as essential businesses and provide a stress-free, fast environment for applicants to complete this requirement. 

      * Eliminate or temporarily suspend other in-person requirements. If your process requires a medical evaluation, allow a medical professional to complete the paperwork based on patients records or via a telehealth visit. 

      * Invest in online solutions that allow families to complete and track paperwork, attend and track orientations and trainings, and upload key documents. 

      * If your child welfare system has a unique requirement, like tuberculosis tests, evaluate whether such a unique requirement is necessary and remove or suspend it if possible.
    costs:
      - Software cost for online tracking system for families
      - Potential cost of mobile fingerprinting machine
    benefits:
      - 'Limiting in-person contact while also limiting delays in licensing '
      - Prevents the loss of placement options
      - May make it easier for families to complete all or some of the
        requirements
    outcome: >-
      States with contracts for community-based fingerprinting sites report the
      same processing times as before the pandemic. For more information on
      fingerprinting, see [How to ensure fingerprinting doesn’t stop your

    title: offer-online-foster-parent-training
    about: >-
      Many agencies have paused their resource family training and licensing
      efforts during the pandemic. However, the need for safe placement options
      for foster children can’t afford to wait. 


      By offering online training and online or telephone recruitment and orientation events, you can continue to license families while limiting in-person contact.
    how: >-
      * Use an existing online foster parent training. The Caregiver Core
      Training (CCT) is an online system developed by the Alliance for Child
      Welfare Excellence in Washington State. You can view their training
      materials
      [here](https://allianceforchildwelfare.org/project/learn-more-about-caregiver-core-training-online).
      If you think this is a viable option for your child welfare agency, you
      can contact Christina Coad at the Alliance directly
      ([ccoad@uw.edu](mailto:ccoad@uw.edu)). 

      * Conduct telephone orientations. Washington, D.C. developed an approach for conducting orientation sessions over the phone which was well received by families who attended. The agency provided a PowerPoint [presentation](https://www.childwelfareplaybook.com/assets/CFSA_Recruitment_Orientation_March_2020_Pride.pptx) for attendees to follow along and had a foster parent on the line to offer a real-world perspective.

      * Conduct online orientations. You can use the same slide deck and materials as you would for an in-person orientation, or add an interactive element by using a platform like [Google Forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/) to create a [scored quiz](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/7032287?hl=en). If your agency uses [Binti](https://binti.com/), you can provide an online orientation video for families to watch. Afterwards, families can complete a quiz in order to get credit.

      * Convert your own in-person training to online training. If you prefer to use your own training instead of an existing online training, you can convert your materials. 

      * Follow promising practices for online training. In developing their own online training, Michigan identified several promising practices: 

        * Offer an online option for families to connect with one another. You can create a closed Facebook group for each class to help participants build connections and form a support group.
        * Schedule frequent classes. For two-parent households, this will allow parents to more easily switch between attending the training and spending time with children.
        * Keep classes short. A full-day class is often too long for many participants to do online. Build in short breaks throughout the class so that participants don’t disengage.
        * Set online meeting guidelines before the first class. Not all participants will be familiar with online meetings. Guidelines can include general expectations, online meeting manners (i.e. how to dress appropriately, when to mute), and instructions on using the technology. Leave time at the beginning of the meeting to assist with any technical difficulties.
        * Include an interactive element, such as a questionnaire for each session to make sure that parents understand the material as the trainer covers it. Cut any hands-on activities that can’t easily be done remotely. Instead, stop to discuss the material more often. 
        * Cap the class at approximately 20 people to make sure that everyone can engage. 
        * You can contact Jessica Sweet at Michigan DHHS if you have any questions ([SweetJ2@michigan.gov](mailto:SweetJ2@michigan.gov)).
    costs:
      - Low to no cost if using existing online materials
      - Potential cost of online meeting software
      - Potential cost to develop online training materials
    benefits:

      - Prevents the loss of placement options
    outcome: >-
      * Los Angeles County found that when given a choice, more than 90% of
      families (approximately 9,000 to date) opted to complete orientation
      online.

      * In addition to being convenient for families and vital during COVID-19, Los Angeles County found that online orientations reduce staff workloads and free up staff time for other priorities.

    how: >-
      * **Collect critical items.** The most frequently needed items include
      fire extinguishers, oven locks, baby gates, first aid kits and medication
      lock boxes. There are several ways you may collect items like these:

        * You can collect donated items in new condition during a “safety inspection” drive, similar to a backpack or canned food drive. Here is sample language for a safety inspection drive.
        * You can work with local partners like churches to host a drive event or a fundraiser. 
        * You can use Family Preservation Service dollars, an existing budgetary tool that can help acquire needed items when used for direct placement. 
      * **Distribute critical items.** Your goal should be to make it as easy as possible for your team to distribute critical safety items to families in need. To do so, keep a stash of essentials in easy-to-access locations like a designated supply closet or the trunk of a case worker’s car. You can also provide key items at a foster parent training or orientation.

      These minor items need to be validated by an inspector and require a
      return visit. 


      Allowing foster families to send photos to confirm the resolution of minor pending items will prevent delays in the licensing process.

      like beds, smoke detectors, and home repairs. 

      * Instruct families with a minor pending item to email a photograph once the item has been resolved. Store the photo with the family’s file. Here is a [sample email](https://www.childwelfareplaybook.com/assets/resolve_minor_pending_items_asset) for this practice.

      * If you’re creating or currently use a foster family online portal, request the ability for families to upload attachments, which would include these photos. Here is a [sample IT request](https://www.childwelfareplaybook.com/assets/resolve_minor_pending_items_asset2) to add such a feature.

    title: send-appointment-reminders
    about: >-
      Home study and inspection appointments are often scheduled for families
      without their input and with confirmation. As a result, families can miss
      critical appointments which delays the licensing process and creates
      unnecessary frustration. 


      Sending appointment reminders to families can help prevent these issues.
    how: You can send an appointment reminder to families via a shared calendar
      invite, physical mail, email or text. If possible, ask families what their
      preferred mode of communication is and send their reminder that way. Here
      are [text

      Interpreters are highly skilled but they may not have child welfare
      specific knowledge. This can make it difficult to translate important
      content (especially on the fly) during foster parent orientation and
      training or in ongoing interactions. 


      Relying on bilingual staff members whenever possible will help ensure that families receive and understand important information and trainings.
    how: >-
      * Ask caregivers about the language they are most comfortable interacting
      in as early as possible, by including this on inquiry forms or at the very
      start of an application process. Case workers should identify whether a
      relative placement needs a translator right away. 

      * Maintain a list of bilingual staff members. Identify work flexibilities that can allow them to take on occasional training responsibilities even if their normal responsibilities are in a different part of the agency. 

      * Use remote meeting capabilities so that families and staff members can work together even if they are in different parts of your state.

      * County-administered systems can pool resources.

      Many youth do not know what programs are available to them. Case workers
      are often managing so many cases that they don’t always have time to
      explain every available program. This means that youth may miss out on
      opportunities to prepare for independence. 


      Instead of requiring case workers to explain each program directly, make it possible for older youth to look through a list of available programming and choose the topics most relevant to them.
    how: >-
      Share a printed or emailed list of all programs with youth. Ask them to
      circle or highlight those that interest them. 


      You can also create a programming calendar online and allow youth to RSVP for programs of interest, using a free tool like Google Forms or Eventbrite.

      difficult for them to receive physical mail. In a multi-state discovery
      sprint with older foster youth, [Think of Us](https://thinkof-us.org/)
      found as many as 30% of mailed calendars were returned to sender. This
      means that as many as 30% of youth never learn about programs being

      Switching from physical mail to using online calendars, email, and text messages to share information about programming and other materials will help ensure that youth do not miss important information.
    how:
      Programming calendars can be posted online and emailed to youth. You could
      also use an online calendar that allows others to subscribe to your
      events, like Eventbrite. A photo of the calendar could also be texted to
      youth.

    about: >-
      In some places, youth in Extended Foster Care must travel to an in-person
      meeting each month to physically receive their EFC stipend. This can be
      very burdensome for youth who are also working or in college, and who may
      not have access to reliable transportation. During the pandemic, this left
      many youth without access to their stipends. 


      By using direct deposit to distribute extended foster care stipends, you can eliminate unnecessary barriers and ensure that youth receive their stipends reliably.
    how:
      Make it a practice to open a bank account for each youth as part of your
      onboarding process. This is the bank account you will use to direct
      deposit their stipends. You should be able to set up a direct deposit
      process through your existing accounting system.

      and other necessities. 


      In a multi-state learning sprint with older foster youth, [Think of Us](https://www.thinkof-us.org/) found that when youth received Target gift cards, they often engaged in a complicated workaround: they purchased miscellaneous Target items, then returned them in batches to receive cash refunds in increments of $10. They then used that cash to buy food at other stores.

      entire year. In a multi-state learning sprint with older foster youth,
      [Think of Us](https://www.thinkof-us.org/) found that when youth hear that
      foster care goes “until 21,” they believe that means “until their 22nd
      birthday,” when really it means that it ends on their 21st birthday.


      If a youth believes that they have an entire extra year in foster care, they may accidentally delay plans and activities that can prepare them for independence. Using precise language to describe the day that foster care ends will help avoid this confusion.
    how:
      Conduct an inventory of your program materials that reference the end of
      foster care (like posters, pamphlets, website content, and handouts).
      Replace any references to “until 21” with “to the end of 20” or “until
      your 21st birthday.” If your program ends at a different age, follow this
      same pattern.

    about: >-
      Use renewal as an opportunity to touch base with families about their
      current needs and goals. Families that are feeling overwhelmed might
      benefit from respite or taking lower-need children for a time, while
      families that are gaining experience may be ready to take on higher-need
      placement. 


      With foster homes in such high demand, it can be all too easy to keep making placements in a home until the family burns out and quits. Using renewal as an opportunity to check-in helps retain families longer. Additionally, it may not be obvious when a family is ready to take on more responsibility and train for higher-need placement. Renewal offers a natural opportunity for these conversations.
    how: >-
      Keep a spreadsheet or calendar of renewal dates. Before the license
      renewal process begins, schedule a check-in call with the family.
      Familiarize yourself with their current and recent placements prior to the
      call. 


      If a family has or recently had a stressful placement or disruption, consider options that might give them a break, including stepping down to take a lower-need placement, being placed on hold, or becoming a respite placement. 


      If a family has become more experienced and seems interested, use this conversation to talk to them about what a higher-need placement might look like and what trainings or experiences are available to them.

      wayside. Mailed reminders can be easily lost in the volume of other
      mailings received from a foster care agency (especially if your agency
      does not distinguish important mail). Most systems do not have an
      electronic portal for families to check their renewal status on their own,
      leaving families dependent on manual communications. 


      Send an email to foster families two to three months before their license expires, outlining the steps required for their renewal.
    how: >-
      * Maintain a spreadsheet of currently licensed families and their renewal
      dates. 

      * Write an email to a current foster family with an upcoming renewal and include every possible renewal requirement. Save this email as a template. 

      * When a family is 60 to 90 days out from their renewal date, send them this email. You can edit the requirement list to reflect their remaining steps as needed.

      available to them is reading books or watching movies, which does not
      maximally prepare caregivers for the needs of foster youth.


      Offer a curriculum of the highest-value trainings, with childcare and meals taken care of, to make completing training hours prior to renewal both simple for families and high-value for the agency.
    how: >-


      * Secure a venue for an all-day training event on a recurring basis at a time convenient for families, like one weekend a month. 

      * Survey parents, listen to questions at foster parent events, and speak with other case workers to identify the most-requested and most-needed trainings. 

      * Plan a day-long training curriculum around the highest-priority trainings for your community. 

      * Post the training online with clear instructions on how to sign up.

      * Notify families with license renewal dates in the next four to six months about the upcoming training dates.

      By updating your recruitment materials, messaging, and inquiry forms, you can highlight the real needs of your child welfare agency: foster families who will prioritize helping to reunify and heal a child’s family of origin or provide permanency for older youth and sibling groups. Case workers should have multiple conversations about potential families’ expectations and work to clarify that fostering is not the right choice for a family that is only looking to adopt an infant.

    heading: Use social media for targeted foster family recruitment
    about:
      Create and regularly update social media presences for your agency, so
      community members can learn more about foster parenting and how to support
      the foster youth in their community. Radio ads, billboards, television
      commercials, and other offline media can help spread awareness of the need for
      more foster families, but a regular cadence of social media posts can raise
      awareness with even more community members.
    outcome: Some California counties have experienced tremendous results using targeted recruitment to find homes for some of their hardest to place children, including those with disabilities and CSEC.
    how: >-
      Work with a professional to develop targeted digital marketing campaigns for the types of families your system needs most. For example, you can target families in specific zip codes or school districts, retired nurses, military families, families who speak particular languages, and more. 
    costs:
      - Varying costs associated with targeted digital campaigns. Once set up, these costs can go down dramatically.
    benefits:
      - Increased foster family recruitment of the exact types of families your children need.

    about:
      Current foster parents who do not work for your Department can provide
      additional empathy and perspectives that can help new families decide to
      sign up, or decide to expand their training or placement preferences.
      Hiring current foster parents to assist as co-trainers in new or
      continuing trainings (or for orientations or early home visits) may also
      help retain the foster parents who are hired.
    how: >-
      Work with your HR department to develop contracts for hiring and paying
      current foster parents. 


      Set clear expectations early about the role(s) for hired foster parents at trainings or other events. They should complement, not replace, experienced trainers and staff.

      Diverse teams can identify and eliminate bias. Having youth with lived
      experience on your team can bring and keep the perspective of foster youth
      to the forefront of everyday tasks. It also provides meaningful employment
      opportunities for youth aging out of care in your system. 


      Child welfare systems are seeing success hiring youth with lived experience as foster parent trainers, clerical support, and foster parent recruiters.
    how: >-


      * Work with your HR department to find the best mechanism for setting aside position(s) specifically for those with lived experience.

      * If possible, make ongoing therapy available and encouraged as part of employment, to help new employees process any feelings or situations that may arise when working within the system.

    heading: Use Extreme Family Finding methods when necessary
    about: >-
      Child welfare systems have limited resources for family finding, and
      family may be unwilling to talk to government officials like Department
      staff. Extreme Family Finding puts a private investigator on the case of
      finding a child’s full family tree, some of whom may be more willing to
      talk to a detective. 


      Children who are selected for Extreme Family Finding can enter with as few as no connections, and a goal of creating a genogram of at least 125 adults. Extreme Family Finding also focuses on youth who are most at risk of aging out of care without permanency. While the primary goal for family finding is to find a permanent placement, this effort is also crucial for building up an entire supportive network for every youth.
    how: >-
      Initial Extreme Family Finding sites were funded by a grant from the
      Children’s Bureau, but even absent an official grant, you can recreate
      parts of the program by:


      * Building extensive genograms for every child in care, with the goal of filling in at least 30-80 connections.

      * Hiring a private investigator to find and talk to family connections for foster youth with few known connections.

      * Preserving known connections as soon as children enter care with heart maps and plans to stay connected to supportive adults.
    costs:
      - Grants may be available

    heading: Include recruiters in follow-up activities
    about: >-
      While separating duties can make your agency feel more efficient, being
      passed between staff members can be confusing and unpleasant for potential
      foster families, even causing them to back out of the process. Warm
      hand-offs and opportunities to stay connected with staff members with whom
      they have developed relationships can help keep potential foster families
      engaged and more likely to continue through the  licensing process. 


      Instead of passing off a potential foster family from a recruiter to a licensor, create more opportunities for warm hand-offs and for recruiting team members to continue seeing and interacting with their families.
    how:
      Identify opportunities for recruitment team members to continue to interact
      with their families, such as through trainings, home visits or community
      events.

  - title: include-placement-and-recruitment-in-case-planning
    heading: Include placement and recruitment teams in regular case planning meetings
    about:
      Recruitment teams can do their best work if they understand the current
      needs and characteristics of youth in care. Without this context, they may
      recruit families who do not best match the needs of youth in care.
      Including recruitment and placement workers in all of your routine
      planning meetings can help ensure that recruiters focus on the most needed
      families.
    how: >-
      * Hold monthly meetings to review youth who do not currently have
      placements or who have non-ideal placements (e.g. placed far away from
      their family of origin). Include case workers, placement workers, and
      recruiters. Ideally, include private agency representatives as well. 

      * Include placement and recruitment team members in your regular planning meetings. 

      * Provide additional ways for placement workers to communicate with case workers to ask questions and learn more about the current needs of youth in care.

  - title: include-pending-families-in-placement-searches
    heading: Include pending families in placement searches
    about: >-
      Foster children often have to move schools or live with strangers who do
      not share their language or culture. Sometimes, a matching family is
      available for a child who otherwise does not have a strong match, but the
      placement team cannot see that family because they have not yet completed
      the application process. 


      Include families who have applied but not yet completed their license in your placement searches. When a child otherwise has no strong match, prioritize licensing a matching pending family.
    how: >-
      Include pending families in your placement searches. If there is a match,
      placement and licensing teams can work together to understand what steps
      must happen right away to license the family, and which steps might be
      able to wait until after placement. If the child does not have to move
      right away, arrange visits or other interactions with the matching family
      as they complete the licensing process. 


      In some jurisdictions, a judge can order a placement with a family that is not yet licensed but is otherwise a strong match for a child.

  - title: recruit-relative-caregivers-to-become-general-caregivers
    heading: Recruit relative caregivers to become general caregivers
    about: >-
      Every child welfare system is looking for more families. Kinship
      caregivers are often already full licensed (or have only minor steps
      remaining to become fully licensed), are familiar with the system, and may
      have fewer negative preconceived notions about foster children. Not every
      relative caregiver may be a good match for or even interested in taking in
      children who they do not know. But even converting a small percentage of
      relative caregivers to general licensed homes can make a big difference in
      the available pool of placement options. 


      Focus some recruitment efforts on existing relative caregivers. Make sure case workers discuss the idea of becoming a general licensed home with relative caregivers at regular points, particularly at permanency milestones like a return home. Your system should have a clear, documented path for “converting” from a relative caregiver to a general licensed home without having to start from scratch.
    how: >-


      * Encourage case workers to discuss the possibility of becoming a general foster home with kinship caregivers. Formally note when a relative caregiver has capacity for additional children in their home (even if they currently have only a child-specific license). 

      * When a placement search reveals no matching general caregivers, look to see if there are matching kinship caregivers. If your system prevents searching across both kinds of caregivers, consider reimagining this when it’s time to redo your CCWIS placements module.

        * In Washington, D.C. case workers track relative caregivers’ capacity and milestones on a monthly basis. If they see a relative caregiver may have extra capacity or after a kinship placement returns home, they initiate conversations about becoming a general foster home instead of closing. 

        * In Indiana, case workers are encouraged to discuss the possibility of taking on additional foster placements with relative caregivers on an individual basis. 

        * In Oklahoma, case workers are trained to discuss options with kinship caregivers. Through mixed training classes, relative caregivers are exposed to the idea of general foster care and can interact with general licensed families.
  - title: reflect-community-in-recruitment

    about: >-
      People often look for themselves in marketing materials. Diverse
      representation helps more people see themselves as potential and valuable
      resource caregivers. 


      Replace generic recruitment materials and photos with thoughtful and inclusive materials that reflect real community members. Images of foster families should include single parents, LGBTQ+ families, people of color, and people with a variety of abilities.
    how: >-


      * Review and update your recruitment and marketing materials (including websites, posters and brochures) to better reflect your community members. Prioritize the communities from which you need more homes in order to keep children within their community. For example, if you need more homes to support trans teenagers, make sure you include trans caregivers and LGBTQ+ positive stories in your materials. In addition to photographs, review materials for inclusive case studies and example scenarios. 

      * Ask for pronouns and preferred names in your inquiry and application forms, and use them. Make it routine for everyone to share pronouns when meeting prospective families, such as at orientation or training. You may need to use a legal name for formal background checks, but otherwise you should refer to individuals by their preferred names. 

      * Confirm that inquiry and application forms support household with single applicants, as well as households with two or three applicants, to support multi-generational households.

    about:
      Every child welfare system needs more ways to support and retain their
      best foster families. Find opportunities to formally recognize your
      current foster families, through awards, events, or gifts. These
      recognition opportunities create positive word of mouth from current
      foster families that attract more families to sign up to foster.
    how:
      Start a recognition program. Even a certificate and a personal note can go
      a long way towards making a foster family feel valued and appreciated (and
      all their friends will see the certificate on the wall). You can also
      commission local businesses to donate free or discounted items as awards
      or gifts for current families.

The squads build camaraderies and help one another through challenges. Each year, there is a competition to see which squad recruits the most new families, with a ceremony and gift card prizes for the winning squad. 

        * Frederick County, MD hosts regular events for current foster families (pivoting them to Google Meet during the pandemic). They have also recognized foster families through a variety of events and strategies including: an annual adults-only reception for foster families (with free, on-site childcare); a drive through celebration where foster families who drove by the office could pick up ready to heat catered meals; drive by caravans where case workers and foster families drive by houses with signs and music; recognition baskets for foster families that included fun items like board games, puzzles, and snacks; welcome baskets for new foster families that include the Department handbook, a water bottle, mugs, and books for both parents and children. 

        * Ohio uses billboards to recognize individual foster families. Some families take friends and picnics to visit their billboard!

        * Indiana works with local businesses to make a variety of discounts and offers available for their foster families.

    heading: Track detailed referral information for new inquiries
    about: >-
      When filling out a foster family inquiry form, most people default to
      saying they heard about fostering “from the website” or “online.” However,
      further questioning reveals they were really exposed through an event at
      their church, a family connection, a radio commercial, or other
      experience. 


      By capturing detailed information about how new foster families were referred to your agency, you can focus on the highest-yield recruitment methods and avoid accidentally stopping methods that were, in fact, successfully recruiting families.
    how: >-


      * Add to your inquiry forms a list of possible events, marketing materials, or other recruitment methods that someone may have been exposed to, and ask which ones interested the person completing the inquiry. 

      * Make sure you have “Other” on your list as well, with a space to freely enter text. Encourage detail by labeling this field “Other (please be specific). 

      * In initial phone calls, ask probing questions about how a family became interested in fostering. Add these details to a central location (like a shared spreadsheet) that can later be tracked.

        * Frederick County, MD asks interested families to specify in detail how they became interested in fostering, and asks them to indicate on their inquiry form all the places where they heard about fostering. This helped them realize that ValPack mailers were actually reaching a lot of families. 

        * Fairfax County, VA does not ask for referral information on its inquiry form, instead asking in the initial orientation phone call. They report that this provides richer and more detailed answers than a form. For instance, if a family says they heard about fostering on their website, staff can ask how they go to the website or if there was something in particular that caught their attention.

      - Low to no cost
    about: >-
      Just because a family is not ready to foster today does not mean that they
      couldn’t be a strong placement option in the future. New data shows that
      it can take some families years between when they first take an interest
      in fostering and when they start an application. When systems delete or
      close out inquiries to meet short-term metrics like conversion rates, they
      also potentially lose out on a number of families who would have completed
      applications in the future. 


      Keep all your potential foster family inquiries open and find ways to keep families engaged with newsletters, email campaigns, and the occasional personal check-in. You can also keep interested families engaged by highlighting other ways for them to support foster youth, such as participating in a donation drive or volunteering at an event.
    how: >-


      * If your team maintains performance metrics around converting inquiries to applications, stop. Instead, focus on opportunities to encourage high-touch interactions with families, like phone calls or meetings, and ways to engage interested families in lower-level commitments like attending an event or participating in a donation drive. 

      * Identify ways to keep in touch with long-standing inquiries without taking up a lot of staff time, such as creating an automated email newsletter. 

      * Have a clear policy about what steps a family has to retake, and in what timeframe, if they begin part of the process but aren’t ready to complete it.

Many families take a long time to complete the application: more families take six or more months than the number of families who complete the application right away.

        * Fairfax County, VA keeps all inquiries open. They report that families can take an average of two to three years to move from an inquiry to an application. 

        * Washington, D.C. adds new inquiries to their newsletter and checks in with families quarterly. They do not close inquiries. They report that they sometimes have a family become licensed after being on their inquiry list for as long as a decade.

    heading: Talk with families as soon as possible when they submit an inquiry
    about: >-
      Becoming a foster parent is a big step, and many potential foster parents
      need more human interaction to reassure them through the process. Call or
      meet with potential foster families when they submit an inquiry, instead
      of relying on automated emails and mailings. Speaking with potential
      families can help clarify expectations and get potential caregivers
      comfortable with moving to the next step. 


      Additionally, when there’s too much automation upfront, families for whom fostering is not a good fit can get far into the process before they have an opportunity to talk with a real person. By speaking with potential families early, you can help dissuade families for whom fostering is not a good fit (e.g. families only interested in adopting infants), so your agency can focus on the families that best meet the needs of your current youth.
    how: Look for opportunities to include a human interaction, such as a phone
      call, early in the inquiry process. If you don’t have the staff resources
      for this, consider hiring current foster parents to help.

    about: >-
      Filling out a form indicating interest in becoming a foster parent is a
      big step. When someone fills out an inquiry form, they might be ready to
      go right away, or they might need time and more information to think about
      making such a significant commitment. If too much time passes before they
      get a response, a potential caregiver may become discouraged, second guess
      themselves, or change their mind. 


      Set a required, short response time for following up with potential foster family inquiries. Responding quickly with more information makes you seem responsive and supportive to new families, gives primed applicants a way to get started and make a more informed choice about whether fostering is right for them, and can help weed out poor fits (e.g. families only looking to adopt infants). By providing information about additional ways to support foster youth, you can also help more hesitant families get and stay engaged.
    how: >-


      * Set a metric, ranging from one to seven days, for how quickly you will respond to new inquiries. This metric should be as short as possible, but realistic given your current staffing and resources. Track initial response times for new inquiries. If they begin to slip, work with your team to identify how to respond faster (such as increasing resources or using calendar reminders). 

      * Create an automated email with links to information on fostering. Consider adding tips for ways to support foster youth without becoming a foster parent. Provide a printed version for families who do not use email. 

      * Create a newsletter (email and/or print) to keep interested families engaged.

      Setting reminders is a simple way to make sure that you stay in touch with potential foster families, and that they feel appreciated.

      * Create a regular newsletter that you send to all families who submit inquiries. It doesn’t have to be long or complicated, and can be just a story or a few links. Consider including information about other ways to support foster youth without (or before) becoming a foster parent. 

      * Create a calendar with reminders to check in with potential foster families. You can also use a task management app with date-based reminders to keep track of which families you need to check in with and when. Ideally, the entire team will share visibility across these lists, so if someone is out sick then another team member can cover their check-in calls.

    heading: Use inquiry data to identify recruitment gaps
    about: Examining inquiry data is one way you can help focus your recruitment
      efforts on the communities or neighborhoods where you most need homes but
      are receiving the fewest inquiries. Compare your inquiry data against any
      data you have about the characteristics of foster homes you need the most
      (e.g. zip codes where children most often experience removal). You can
      then clearly identify gaps where recruitment efforts can be focused.
    how: Track data from your inquiry form (like caregiver’s interests, tribal
      status, language spoken, or zip code) against the characteristics you most
      need in foster families. You can then prioritize licensing matching
      families, while expanding or focusing your recruitment efforts in the
      communities where you have the biggest gaps in need.

  - title: digital-marketing-for-recruitment
    heading: Use digital marketing campaigns for foster family recruitment
    about: >-
      We use online marketing to sell shoes and houses, but very few child
      welfare systems are taking advantage of this avenue for recruiting new
      foster homes. Unlike radio ads or billboards that must appeal to a wide
      audience, online ads can be highly customized to focus on caregivers who
      meet the certain characteristics your foster children most need, such as
      caregivers who speak particular languages or work in a specific
      profession. 


      Leveraging targeted digital marketing campaigns, alongside your other recruitment methods, can be more successful at finding these families than more generic campaigns.
    how: Work with a digital marketing expert to design your first campaign.
      Together, you can determine what kind(s) of caregivers you’d like to
      recruit; what collateral (e.g. email content, website landing page) you’ll
      need to create; and what the right budget is. Online advertisements do
      cost money, but can have a higher return on investment than some analog
      recruitment methods.

    about:
      Case workers don’t want to wake a director in the middle of the night to
      sign-off on a non-relative placement. Requiring this level of sign-off
      incentivizes early family finding and may prevent placements in group
      homes.
    how:
      Require senior staff sign-off for non-relative placements, no matter the
      time of day. You should require sign-off on initial placements, subsequent
      placements, and any congregate care placements.

  - title: use-heart-map
    heading: Use a Heart Map to identify a youth’s important relationships
    about: >-
      Many foster youth enter care with more connections than they leave with.
      If a supportive adult is not an immediate placement option, they are
      usually not tracked meaningfully by the system. But even if a contact does
      not serve as a placement option, they can still be an important part of a
      youth’s supportive network. 


      The Heart Map exercise provides a meaningful way for staff to surface contacts with youth, in order to strengthen and maintain those relationships.
    how: >-


      * Download a printable [Heart Map](https://www.childwelfareplaybook.com/assets/heartmap.pdf). As soon as a youth enters care, walk them through the Heart Map to quickly surface people who are important to them. 

      * Encourage youth to list “someone in their heart” on each line, and draw more lines as needed. The two existing lines on the heart are strategic: More than one line prompts thinking about multiple relationships, but too many lines can be disheartening if youth cannot fill them all in. 

      * Make an action plan to set up visits, phone calls, social media, and/or other continuing connections with each identified contact. Share the action plan with a youth’s entire team, including their foster parents, so everyone can help achieve it.

Paying for respite, whether by providing funds or a respite provider, helps foster parents to avoid burnout and potentially support youth with higher levels of need.
    how: >-

    costs:
      - Equilvalent to FTE salaries with benefits
    about: Many children in institutions could be thriving in a dedicated family setting. Requirements that foster parents have a separate source of income and employment means that willing and experienced homes cannot provide the full-time care that some children need. Professional, or salaried, foster parents are an emerging answer to this challenge.
    how: >-
      * Develop a pilot professional foster parent program. Identify payment rates, expectations (professional foster parents should not be able to disrupt their placement for a set period of time, like six months), and from where you will recruit your initial parents. We encourage you to reach out to existing programs to learn from and model them!

      * Waive income requirements for professional foster parents, because the expectation is that their job is now meeting the needs of the child in their home.

      * Provide 24/7 wraparound services and other supports to professional foster parents to support and maintain the placement.
    outcome: Washington DC's professional foster parents have achieved a placement stability rate of 95%.

    about: The best social media policies in child welfare enable staff to take advantage of its many benefits while protecting the privacy of children, families, and employees.
    how: >-
      A comprehensive social media policy covers topics like: 

      * **Limiting accounts** — Provide official shared work accounts or have staff create  accounts that they only use for work. Don’t allow workers to use their personal accounts for family finding. 

      * **Confidentiality** — Don’t share private information through social media messages. Just as you would leave a generic voicemail when trying to identify kin, encourage social media contacts to reach out to you directly for follow-up. 

      * **Respecting family privacy** — If a public child welfare account were to “friend” a possible family member, that would publicly reveal that the family member is having an interaction with child welfare. Workers should not update profiles, post public messages, or “friend” other accounts when using official work accounts for family finding. 

      * **Making staffing decisions** — Decide if a central team will conduct social media family finding activities, or if all workers will be granted access. There are pros and cons to both approaches. 

      * **Requiring official cause** - Using social media should be _mandatory_ when looking for kin and when recruiting more foster families. At the same time, workers should not look up family members purely out of curiosity. 

      * **Handling records management** — As a government agency, your social media messages may be subject to things like public records requests. You can use tools to automatically archive all your official social media accounts. 

      * **Unblocking social media sites** — Management may have to meet with IT to have certain social media sites unblocked from the network. (Let us know if you need help with this!)

    about: Foster parents may mean well when posting on social media, but seemingly innocent stories and photos can easily violate the privacy of foster youth in their home. This can be an especially tricky area to navigate for kinship caregivers.
    how: >-
      * Review your privacy policy with current kinship caregivers to make it clear what they can and cannot post on social media. This can be tricky when grandma would _normally_ post family photos, but if grandma is currently a kinship caregiver, she cannot post those photos without permission from the child's parent(s).

      * Instead of posting photos of youth online, such as in galleries of youth available for adoption, use images of concepts and items that are representative of that child, such as horses or art supplies. Adoption websites are not catalogs.

      * Make it explicitly clear to families that covering a child's face with an emoji or other shape is not sufficient; they cannot post images online at all.

      * Use private technology tools to enable (and encourage!) sharing of photos and other information between foster families and the child's famil of origin. Keep this material off social media.

      * If workers see inappropriate photos posted on social media, encourage them to reach out gently but firmly to remind families of  privacy rules. It has become a trend to post images of children in care with funny emojis covering their faces, which may give families a false impression that this behavior is allowed.

    about: When the licensing workers who interact with and really know a family get to make decisions about how to approve or mitigaten non-safety exceptions for relatives, everyone benefits. A supervisor or area administrator who has never met a family is often not the best person to make a judgement call, and that can lead to denials that lack nuance — which ultimately means fewer kids in kinship care. Localized decision making means faster and higher licensing rates for relatives.
    how: >-
      * Review your exception approval process. Consider removing some or all higher approval steps. If this is too drastic a shift, start with making a list of exceptions that licensing workers can mitigate directly, and only require higher level approvals for others. For example, some systems let licensing workers approve everything except criminal histories.

      * Limit documentation of undocumented status. Don't document immigration status (whether documented or not) in your IT system.

    costs:
      - None
    about: Title IV-E of the Social Security Act, which governs foster care maintenance payments and licensing, specifically says that states can make exceptions to any "non-safety" licensing requirements for relatives. Most states have artificially limited their flexibility around exceptions — but you can fix this by following in the footsteps of states that have maximum flexibility.
    how: >-
      * Borrow policy verbiage from states with maximum flexibility to grant exceptions to relatives. The only licensing requirements that are "safety" issues are those that would prevent placement (such as a disqualifying criminal history). Here's the law, so you can easily reference it: "(D) that a waiver of any standards established pursuant to subparagraph (A) may be made only on a case- by-case basis for non-safety standards (as determined by the State) in relative foster family homes for specific children in care."  

      * If you currently allow _some_ exceptions, change this to allow all non-safety issues. Do not have a specific list of relative exceptions. 

      * If you don't currently allow any licensing exceptions for relatives, start! Use states that already have this flexibility, listed below, as a guide (and feel free to reach out to us for help). 

      * Carefully define "safety" and "non-safety." This trips up many systems. If a kinship caregiver is safe enough to place, then by definition, any other issues are non-safety issues. A safety issue is only something that would cause you to immediately remove a child from that person's care. Under this definition, **ALL** kinship caregivers with placement should qualify for a license. 

      * Acknowledge there will be a small handful of exceptions. You may have a kinship caregiver with a disqualifying federal criminal history but is a court-ordered placement. In this case, the caregiver won't be eligible for IV-E reimbursement. But this should be an extremely rare situation.

    about: Exceptions to licensing requirements for relatives don't have to be entirely separate forms or processes. Many systems incorporate this mitigation and decision making within the standard process, such as the home study template. In systems that allow relative nonsafety exceptions, these exceptions happen _more often than not_ — so instead of treating it as an exceptional circumstance, treat it as a routine one.

      - None, unless you provide incentive payments for this
    about: There's a difference between the number of available beds the placement desk can see in its database, and the number of placements who answer the phone — especially during off-hours. Having specific "shifts" during which current foster families know they might receive an emergency placement call can help ensure every child has options at every hour.
    how: >-
      * Ask foster families to sign up to be on call. They might have times they can easily commit to already, or you might ask them to sign up for specific shifts. If this is on a volunteer basis, do your best to accommodate _their_ schedules and preferences. Incorporate these preferences into your placement data, whether directly in the IT system or through a separate spreadsheet.

If they receive a call, they have a no-reject, no-eject policy for 14 days. These families are for children under the age of 12. There is a second program, Emergency Response X, for children age 12 and older, with lighter requirements around no-reject/no-eject. These families are to support DCYF in assessment, planning for transition, etc.

The state can sometimes provide this higher stipend for longer than the 7 days if necessary.

  - heading: Designate some homes specifically for emergency placements
    costs:
      - None unless you pay emergency homes a higher rate
    about: Some foster homes are particularly well-suited to supporting emergency placement for short stays, which can give overtaxed placement desks enough time to find kinship placements or a well-matched general licensed family.
    how: >-
      * Create a specific license or license designation for emergency homes. Set clear expectations for these homes, such as when they need to answer the phone, whether they can reject placements, whether they must commit to keeping a placement for a certain length of time, and if they have certain specific responsibilities (such as getting a child set up with enough clothes, transporting to the school of origin, etc.). You might require specific training for these homes. 

      * Limit emergency placement lengths. An emergency placement should not last more than 7 days, and ideally not more than 2-3 days. The goal is to have just enough time to be able to identify and reach kin, or a well-matched foster family, _not_ to serve as a real placement.

Emergency care means a child who is already in care and their placement disrupts for some reason, but we already know the child; families receive a higher stipend for up to 10 days. Crisis care means a child who needs to come into care during off-hours, and there is a list of foster parents who agree to be called; they receive a higher stipend for up to 5 days. 

        * **Washington** has a special contract for a private child placing agency that provides receiving care. 

        * **Michigan** has transitional placement providers, which is a contract with current licensed foster parents. These homes have preferences, but cannot decline a placement within those preferences. They must keep the placement for 2-4 weeks. They are paid $100 a day during placement plus $245 a month to keep the bed open when they don't have a child there. This is mostly used for children new to care, or kids with higher levels of need. In order to qualify, an adult in the home must be home (not working). These homes are also eligible for longevity bonuses.

  - heading: Check in frequently on first placements
    costs:
      - Staff time
    about: No matter how many hours of training they've had, it's a different experience once a child is placed in your home. This is particularly the case for kinship caregivers who may have had no notice their life was about to change. A little extra support during this transition period can go a long way towards making a placement successful and retaining foster homes for the long term.
    how: >-
      * Update your practices to include regular check-ins with resource families after they take their first placement. The specific person who should check in may vary by agency, but it should be a consistent person. Kinship caregivers should also get these calls. Milestones might include the first night, right before any key meetings, the first day a child attends school (if different from the first day of placement), and at least once a week for the first month.

      * Ask open-ended questions. How's it going? Do they need anything? Do they have any questions? This is a great opportunity to identify any additional supports that may be needed and get them in place proactively.

      * Depending on your agency's policies around childcare providers, you may need to perform background checks or other steps to assess childcare providers ahead of time.

      * Childcare should be for children in foster care as well as other children in the home. The care itself doesn't have to be fancy; putting on a movie can be enough.

    costs:
      - Staff time
    about: There is so much to do and there are so many emergencies to handle that it can be easy to assume that no news is good news in the case of your existing resource families, but this is not alway the case. Regular check-ins can surface issues of all sizes proactively, so you have enough time to fix individual or systemic issues before they cause you to lose families altogether.
    how: >-
      * Try to make check-ins a human interaction, instead of relying on a paper or electronic survey. This takes more time but gets much richer information and much higher response rates. The worker conducting the check-in should capture what they learn on a structured form for internal analysis and reporting.

      * Make it as easy as possible for families to participate in check-ins. Work around their schedule, provide childcare, offer different meeeting options (in-person coffee or video chat or phone call).

      * Incorporate check-ins with existing meetings. If you have a worker going to do a home visit anyway, make it a practice for them to talk to the caregiver privately about how they're doing and whether they have questions or unmet needs. The worker should capture this information and there should be clear steps for follow-up.

      * Develop an agency practice for evaluating all check-in information at a regular cadence (such as quarterly or every six months) to look for high-level trends or themes that may indicate the need for new programs or supports, or changes. Sort information by area and by worker if you are in a larger system. You don't need a data scientist to spot problems.

  - heading: Measure retention carefully
    costs:
      - None
    about: The percentage of families that your system retains as resource parents can be a misleading number if not tracked carefully. There are plenty of good, or at least neutral, reasons for a family closing its beds, such as adopting their current placement, moving out of state, or perhaps reaching a certain age. There are also some families for whom fostering is just not a good fit, and it's best for them and for children in care that they part ways with your agency. Retention goals should focus on families willing and able to meet the needs of children in care, but who drop out due to frustration or burnout—and this starts by being able to measure and differentiate how you're performing with those families.
    how: >-
      * Formally capture when a family stops serving as a resource family. This might be when their license expires, when they submit a letter of termination, or when a kinship placement ends. If you do not have such clear milestones, come up with one, such as "has not taken a placement in over 12 months."

      * Capture the reason when caregivers close their license in your IT system. While all their answers won't necessarily be honest (it's hard to capture "they quit because they hated their worker" in a note), it's a start.

      * Differentiate between reasons that could have been avoided with agency action, and those that could not. Focus your efforts only on the former.

      * Host a monthly (at least) event for separated siblings. Make it fun and seasonal. It could be as simple as meeting at a playground or petting zoo, or an existing community event like an outdoor kids' concert. Your foster parent support groups may be able to volunteer to coordinate events, or at least suggest locations or existing events to join.

      * Invite separated siblings to existing events. If you are already having a community event, invite the families of separated siblings to all attend.

      * Send separated sibling groups to regular camp. You don't need a special camp for separated siblings; you could raise funds or provide grants to send siblings to existing camps.

      * Create a summer camp for separated siblings. This can be challenging to start, but you can collaborate with local non-profits, existing summer camps, and models from other states with existing sibling camps to create a pilot program for next summer. It could be an afternoon in the park with agency employees running activities at first; it doesn't have to be a week-long sleepaway camp.

  - heading: Never stop looking for a placement that can take an entire separated sibling group
    costs:
      - Time
    inspiration: Oklahoma tracks separated siblings in a dedicated part of its monthly Recruitment Report.
    about: While almost every state officially keeps looking for placements that can reunite separated sibling groups, this practice can easily fall by the wayside over time. Systems need to put measures in place to continue this search. Note that if a sibling group is separated but all siblings are with kin, it is likely not necessary to continue searching for a placement, unless specific circumstances warrant it.
    how: >-
      * Confirm that you can generate a report of children in foster care who are separated from at least one sibling, distinguishing by kinship and non-kinship placement.

      * Confirm that siblings who are separated in foster care and not all with kinship caregivers remain on the recruitment lists for the recruitment and placement teams.

      * Confirm that regular case check-ins (which may be called Family Team Decision Meetings, Child and Family Team meetings, or something else in your jurisdiction) include updates on recruitment efforts for separated sibling groups who are not all placed with kin.

    costs:

    inspiration: "Fairfax County, VA's [policy](LINK TO COLLEEN)."
    about: Sibling connection is about much more than a monthly in-person visit. It can be invites to school events, birthday calls and cards, and regular everyday connections like playing in the park on a nice day. Resource parents of separated sibling groups should collaborate to help keep them connected in large and small ways; this is not a responsibility of the system or social worker alone.
    how: >-
      * When siblings are separated in care, their respective resource parents should be connected right away, unless there are case-specific reasons not to.

      * Case workers can encourage resource parents to collaborate by gently checking in on a regular basis about how sibling visits are going. If parents are reticent, case workers should be empowered to set up an initial visit to break the ice.

      * General foster parents (non-kin) should be expected to faciliate sibling connections through phone calls, video chats, and in-person visits. They should not have the option to opt-out of this responsibility.

        * **Oklahoma** encourages resource parents with separated siblings to bring the children together as often as possible.

        * **New Hampshire** promotes natural collaboration between parents and resource parents. 

        * **Washington DC**’s social worker team ensures resource parents understand the expectation for sibling visits and that the Agency supports this practice; in all, it’s a collected effort with the entire team.

Resource Parent Support Workers ensure families have connections and opportunities to get siblings together on their own as well.

  - heading: Provide transportation for sibling visits

    about: Transportation can often be the biggest barrier to sibling visits. Providing options, especially for younger children who can't navigate cabs or public transit on their own, can mean more and easier sibling visits.

    about: Adult siblings (who have existing relationships with their younger siblings) should not have to jump through hoops for visits. This is especially true for siblings who are only just now aging out of foster care themselves.
    how: >-
      * Examine whether your system has barriers, like court petitions, background checks, or social worker sign-off, to familiar adult siblings setting up visits. (It is acceptable for some evaluation, like a background check, if the adult sibling is unknown to the sibling or the case, but now wants to be involved.)

Per Section 471(a)(31) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(31)), 10A O.S. §§1-4-807 and 1-4-811, and Oklahoma Administrative Code 340:75-6-85, DHS makes ongoing reasonable efforts to place sibling groups together in both temporary and permanent placements. When joint placement of siblings is unsafe or contrary to the child's well-being, DHS must justify and document the justification for the decision, make monthly efforts to resolve the barriers to joint placement, provide frequent visitation, and arrange for ongoing interaction. Frequent contact, such as face-to-face visitation, phone calls, email, social media, or mail contact between siblings is arranged. DHS must make efforts to resolve barriers to joint placement and visitation a minimum of once a month. 

        * **Washington** has a robust policy:

          * Children placed apart from their siblings will have two or more face-to-face visits or contacts per month, unless there is an approved exception, as listed in Procedures Section 4. Additional approved forms of sibling contact are encouraged to support and maintain sibling relationships. Approved forms of contact include, but are not limited to: Telephone contact; Electronic contact through video chat or email.

          * Ongoing visitation is encouraged to promote and maintain the continuity of sibling relationships that existed prior to placement. This includes siblings who: Remained in the home at the time of removal; Aged out of foster care; Returned home; Are placed with a non-custodial parent; or Lived part-time in the home at the time of the sibling’s removal.
          * Sibling contact during family time meets the requirement for a sibling visit.
          * Shared planning meetings or court events do not meet the requirement for a sibling visit.
          * The first sibling visit must occur as soon as possible after placement.
          * Sibling visits will continue after a parent’s rights are terminated or relinquished unless an approved exception applies.
          * Sibling visits cannot be limited or used as a sanction for a child’s behavior or as an incentive to change a child’s behavior.
          * Sibling visit plans will be developed within 14 calendar days and in consultation with the out-of-home caregiver and child, when developmentally appropriate, unless an approved exception applies.
