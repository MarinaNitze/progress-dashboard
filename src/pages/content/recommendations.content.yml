    about: To speed up the process and reduce application costs, offer ways for
      people to submit background check requests electronically. When people
      submit requests by mail, this leads to longer wait times and more
      opportunity for clerical mistakes.
    how: >-
      * Create a secure, generic email address for receiving requests instead of
      using an individual’s account. This provides a consistent process that
      won’t be disrupted by staff transition or vacation time.

      * Make your request form computer friendly. Turn your current form into a fillable PDF, Google form, or a standard Microsoft Word document. Paper forms have to be completed and scanned, creating additional barriers to submitting them — and then for reading them.

      * Provide an online portal for accepting background check requests the next time your agency updates the website.

      to state. To get foster families approved faster, start out-of-state
      background checks early.
    how: >-
      * Ask prospective foster families if they’ve lived out-of-state during
      your initial meeting with them — or even before, when you can.

      * Find the relevant Adam Walsh/out-of-state background check forms, either in your state or county’s Adam Walsh database or on the other state’s website.

      * Take a laptop to orientation for people interested in being foster parents and help them fill out online background check forms.

      * Take paper background check forms and make sure people understand how to fill them out.

      * If any of the background check forms require notarization, arrange for a volunteer notary to attend orientation and sign off on multiple forms at once.

    about: >-
      Social media is widely used across cultural, geographic, and economic
      groups. This makes social media a powerful and unique tool for finding
      family members of youth in foster care. 


      Other people-finding tools — like credit searches — have limited databases. For example, you have to have a credit history to appear in most of them.
    how: >-
      Search popular social media sites like Facebook for known family members,
      such as a youth’s parents or older siblings. From there, look through
      public messages, photos, and friend lists to identify additional
      connections and message them. 


      Before you start using social media for family finding, create a policy to guide staff. Cover topics like:


      * **Limiting accounts** — Provide official shared work accounts or have staff create  accounts that they only use for work. Don’t allow workers to use their personal accounts for family finding.  

      * **Confidentiality** — Don’t share private information through social media messages. Just as you would leave a generic voicemail when trying to identify kin, encourage social media contacts to reach out to you directly for follow-up.

      * **Respecting family privacy** — If a public child welfare account were to “friend” a possible family member, that would publicly reveal that the family member is having an interaction with child welfare. Workers should not update profiles, post public messages, or “friend” other accounts when using official work accounts for family finding. 

      * **Making staffing decisions** — Decide if a central team will conduct social media family finding activities, or if all workers will be granted access. There are pros and cons to both approaches.

      * **Unblocking social media sites** — Management may have to meet with IT to have certain social media sites unblocked from the network.

      The beginning of foster care is a difficult and emotional time for
      children and their families. Both children and adults may be too stressed
      or afraid to share a complete list of connections during an initial
      meeting. 


      Reduce the risk that children will permanently lose important connections by checking in regularly about their networks. Different timing and questions often uncover more connections. And when children are in foster care for a while, they may also develop new relationships with people who can provide vital support. 


      Invite youth and the known adults in their lives — like birth parents, family, other kin, and even foster parents — multiple times to share a list of supportive connections.
    how: >-
      * Review the list of known connections at recurring planning meetings. Ask
      all participants if they can think of anyone who is missing.

        * **Ohio** is developing a new quality hearing court guide that includes prompting for the identification of missing supportive adults. It will guide the judge or magistrate to ask participants about whether relatives have been explored, pursued, and where they are in the process. It will also prompt courts to ask about kinship placement and whether the caregiver is linked with training, services and financial support.

    how: >-
      * Supervisors of child welfare workers can make it a practice to regularly
      ask, “What did the youth say?”

      * Ask youth about their supportive connections at every placement change, and at regular intervals — annually, for example.

      * Phrase inquiries carefully so that young people don’t feel like they have to supply a placement option or they will be homeless. Helpful prompts include: “Who came to your last family gathering?” and “Who would you call if you needed a ride home from school?”

      * Help youth stay connected to supportive adults, even when they’re not a placement option. Create opportunities for regular phone calls, visits, or other contact.

      When you connect with a youth’s kin, make it a point to always ask them if
      they know of other potential kin, whether they may be current connections
      to the child or family members that they haven’t yet met.


      Children can’t have too many adults who care about them. Most youth enter foster care with more connections than they leave with. Making sure to ask kin you know about to help identify additional kin, especially if children are too young to share on their own, can create a broader supportive network.
    how: >-
      * Make it a standard practice to ask kin about other kin during initial
      and ongoing kin contacts

      savvy with social media to engaging newfound kin without scaring them. Not
      every case worker has these skills, and most already have demanding

      A small team dedicated to finding family will help:


      * Free up case workers for other tasks

      * Test out promising new strategies and standardize effective practices 

      * Save money on subscription-based family-finding tools


      Form a dedicated family-finding team for your child welfare system, instead of relying on individual case workers to find kin for the children on their caseload.
    how: >-
      * Create a new team or department for family finding.

      * Charge this new team with specific tasks, like:

        * Using family-finding tools
        * Making initial contacts with potential kin
        * Establishing plans for staying in touch with kin
        * Searching for more kin at regular intervals
        * Prioritizing kin searches for children who are currently placed with non-kin
      * Put processes in place to ensure regular communication and collaboration across teams. Even with a dedicated team, finding kin is still everyone’s responsibility. Other case workers, planning meeting attendees, and young people are all resources for identifying and locating more kin.

    title: supportive-adults-have-robust presence
    about: Most youth leave foster care with fewer connections than they entered
      with. However, most supportive adults want to be more involved in
      supporting the youth in their lives. Keeping these adults engaged and
      involved in case planning can help keep youth from exiting care without
      connections. Invite at least three times as many supportive adults as paid
      staff members to planning meetings to maximize the benefits of this
      support network.
    how: >-
      * Redesign your planning meeting invitation - The invitation should serve
      as a prompt and remind staff to invite as many supportive adults as they
      can, ideally three times as many supportive adults as paid staff members. 

      * Redesign your meeting sign in sheet - Provide enough room for supportive adults to sign in for in-person meetings. For example, you might have four times as many lines in the “supportive adult” area than in the “staff” area. 

      * Ask youth about supportive adults in their lives - Staff should make sure that supportive adults are aware of and invited to planning meetings. You might even ask youth to suggest a supportive adult themselves. 

      * Keep track of meeting attendance - With a simple spreadsheet, you can keep track of the breakdown of roles at planning meetings. Use this information to keep track of progress towards the goal of having three times as many supportive adults as paid staff in attendance.

        simple Excel spreadsheet, with regular exports from their IT system.

        * **Ohio** has Youth Centered Permanency Round Tables (YCPRT) running in several counties. For YCPRTs, the youth is asked to bring a support person to the meeting. It can be anyone: a caregiver, a friend of the family, a member of the family, or anyone the youth feels is supportive of them. That can also initiate more conversations and discussion about permanency options and supports for the youth. One youth asked his fast food manager to come with him, and the manager didn’t even know he was in foster care. The manager ended up adopting him!

        * In **Ohio**, the practice for maintaining connections is: any youth 14 and over is able to have two support persons join in on the family team meetings and case plan meetings. That helps to initiate discussion of any other support persons available to the child.

      fewer disruptions and will be able to better maintain their existing
      relationships. Using an expansive legal definition of kin will allow staff
      to find more placement options for youth more quickly. 


      Even if a connection cannot serve as a placement, youth need as many supportive adults around them as possible. Maintaining an expansive legal definition of kin will allow you to create a broader support system for youth.
    how: >-
      * When asking youth or supportive connections about placement options,
      make it clear that a kinship connection does not need to be a blood
      relation. You can also ask about family friends, teachers or the spouses
      of relatives. Some agencies consider these relationships to be “fictive
      kin.”

      * By asking about connections repeatedly over time, you can include important relationships that a youth has developed since entering care.

      * Some agencies will verify a relationship with a non-kin placement through conversations with the child, a parent or a third party such as a teacher or [clergy](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/foster-care/kinship-care).

      Foster parents may be reluctant to maintain a child’s previous connections, if they think doing so will harm their chances for adoption. However, even if the child is adopted, they deserve to have a strong support network. Making this a formal responsibility of foster parents can help keep a youth’s connections intact throughout their time in care.

      consider making a genogram. After that, you should:


      * **Locate contact information for each supportive connection.** Staff may need to use social media to do so. 

      * **Make a formal plan to stay in touch with each connection.** Plans could include weekly Facetime or phone calls, exchanging letters or emails, in-person visits, providing transportation, or attending school events. You can even make a plan to stay in touch with a pet, such as visits to a dog park.

        * [**California** State Code](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=WIC&sectionNum=16501.1)requires that the child welfare system make a plan for maintaining supportive connections for foster youth 10 and older.
  - heading: Use a red team to prevent placements in group homes
    title: red-team-to-prevent-group-home-placements
    about: Fewer youth will enter group homes if there is a team dedicated to
      finding alternative placements. A red team should be a diverse group of
      agency staff, who conduct kin research, construct a genogram, and ask
      youth directly about possible placements. The team should be empowered to
      rapidly brainstorm, make decisions, and pursue alternatives to group home
      placements.
    how: >-
      * **Assemble a diverse team.** Strong team members will have a reputation
      for problem solving. Appoint a senior leader for the team. 

      * **Formally state the goal.** The goal of the red team is to find an alternative placement to group homes for every youth.

      * **Require a red team meeting before any youth can be placed in a group home.** You may require a meeting before additional scenarios, such as placing a youth out of state or placing a youth in a general foster home with other unrelated youth.

      * **Ask about connections.** As part of their process, the red team should construct a genogram and plan to ask youth about possible placement options. 

      * **Consider requiring senior staff sign-off.** If you do not have the resources to create an entire team or want to add an additional level of incentive, you may consider requiring senior staff sign-off for any non-kin placements. Requiring this level of sign-off can create more incentive for early family finding. Some states utilize a policy that requires senior staff sign-off even in the middle of the night.
    costs:
      - Staff time
    benefits:
      - Avoid placing children in general foster care or group homes who have
        kinship options
      - Staff may be able to increase initial kinship placements
      - Find more kin who can take placement and/or serve as supportive
        connections for youth
    outcome: >-
      * **Rhode Island** has begun to depopulate group homes by requiring a red
      team before any group placement, or any placement into a home that already
      has at least one other unrelated foster child.

      * **New Mexico** increased initial kinship placements from 3% to 40% in one year by shifting to practices that included requiring Director-level approval for non-kin placements.
    who:
      number: 1
      what: >-
        * **Rhode Island** holds a red team meeting, led by the Chief of Staff
        of the Department, before a child is placed in a group home or in a
        general foster home with other unrelated foster youth. As part of the
        red team, the family finding office conducts kin research, the team
        constructs a genogram, and they ask the youth directly about possible
        placement ideas.

        * **New Mexico** has a policy that a Director must approve any placement with non-kin (whether general foster care or a group home), even if it’s the middle of the night.
  - heading: Be gentle when interacting with kin for the first time
    title: be-gentle-when-interacting-with-kin-first-time
    about: >-
      Kinship connections may be permanently lost if an initial communication
      feels too overwhelming and demanding. Some connections may be learning
      they have a family member for the first time while simultaneously being
      asked to serve as a placement. Additionally, staff may feel that they need
      to move immediately to the next kin connection if an initial connection
      cannot serve as a placement. 


      However, engaging newfound kinship connections with gentler techniques from the start can help prevent losing important connections.
    how: >-
      * **Develop a list of guiding questions for staff to be used in initial
      conversations.** Staff should begin with smaller asks, especially if the
      kin is learning about a family member for the first time or has not been
      in touch for a long time. For example, staff may ask: “Do you have a
      family photo you can send?”

      * **Don’t limit initial conversations to placement discussions.**  Even if a placement option is urgently needed, youth need a long-term support network too. Overwhelming kinship connections risks losing those connections.

      * **Make sure that kin are aware of other ways to support youth.** If someone cannot serve as a placement option, they can still stay connected to a youth through visits or attending a planning meeting. Include as many kin as possible in your formal plans to stay connected.
    costs:
      - Revisions to workflow
      - Staff time
    benefits:
      - More supportive adults found and engaged in a youth’s life
      - Kin may eventually be able to serve as a placement option or supportive
        adult
    outcome: While we don’t have exact data for this recommendation, anecdotal data
      from our members suggests that many kin who aren’t placements on day one
      eventually serve as placements and/or supportive connections later on.

    heading: Align checklists to statutes
    about: By aligning licensing checklist items to specific statutes, you can help
      decision-makers understand the source of these legal requirements. This
      ensures that decision-makers clearly understand the source of a problem,
      so they can identify the most effective solution. For example, a landline
      telephone requirement creates a challenge for many families as most people
      are now in mobile-only households. By highlighting the statute behind this
      requirement, a decision-maker can better consider whether it is enough to
      change the requirement, or if the policy behind the requirement needs to
      be updated and modernized as well.
    how: >-
      * Create or locate a list of all checklist items.

      * Identify the legal requirement for each item.

      * Add the statute number next to each item on the checklist. 

      * Consider how you might update items that are challenging to families. Can you update the requirement, or does the policy need to be changed?

    about: Case workers spend a significant amount of time on licensing paperwork,
      which is time they could otherwise spend directly with families or on
      evaluations. By providing clerical support for case workers, you can
      reduce the amount of paperwork that case workers are responsible for.
    how: >-
      Hire one or more clerical workers (depending on the size of your office).
      You may be able to leverage clerical staff in another department or
      convert an existing position. 


      A clerical worker can send and receive physical mail and email, keep track of paperwork requirements for each family, track renewal requirements, send appointment reminders, track background check paperwork, and handle other clerical responsibilities.
    costs:

  - heading: Give families a dedicated licensor
    title: give-families-a-dedicated-licensor
    about: >-
      Each part of the licensing process is often managed by different case
      workers. This has several negative effects, such as lengthening the
      process, increasing the likelihood of errors, and leaving each case worker
      with different pieces of information. 


      By dedicating a single case worker to the entire licensing process, you can increase high-touch engagement. The case worker will be able to get a more holistic and nuanced view of the family. It also increases family satisfaction, as they don’t get confused by multiple case workers.
    how: >-
      * Dedicating a single case worker to licensing will only add value if
      there are no more than 2-3 families per case worker. Look across your
      existing team and identify opportunities to expand the scope of some or
      all workers’ roles in exchange for smaller case loads. 

      * Consider restructuring teams that have highly-specialized roles within the licensing process to more generalized roles. This requires careful planning and cross-training. 

      * Pilot this effort with one or two workers who are interested in being dedicated licensors. Survey families they work with and families other team members work with to evaluate whether there is a meaningful difference in satisfaction, withdrawal rates, or licensing completion times. 

      * Providing adequate clerical support is still valuable in a team with dedicated licensors.
    costs:
      - Cost of restructuring teams and/or retraining staff
    benefits:
      - Increased family satisfaction
      - Increase family retention rates

      Put a sticker or colored circle on critical mail, such as renewal letters.
      Communicate with families early on that they need to open and respond to
      any mail with this particular marking. 


      Choose your priority mail wisely. If you put a sticker on every envelope, this technique will stop being effective.

  - heading: Help relative placements access financial assistance
    title: help-relative-placements-access-financial-assistance
    about: >-
      Sometimes, the biggest barrier to getting kinship families licensed is not
      safety concerns but financial requirements. Financial issues may be the
      only reason a relative placement doesn’t qualify. However, there are
      various programs that can provide assistance to these families and help
      them to get licensed. 


      Help relative placements access other financial assistance to meet the minimum licensing requirement. Better yet, you can waive financial requirements entirely for relative placements, recognizing that poverty should not keep families apart.
    how: >-
      * Connect relative placements to assistance upfront. Provide a list of
      benefits that families may qualify for or offer one-on-one application
      assistance. Examples of benefits include: TANF, SNAP, unemployment
      insurance, social security, and VA benefits. 

      * Customize the application assistance and instructions for your area, such as providing necessary translations. 

      * Conduct a parallel process and carry out the licensing process while families are still working to meet the financial requirements. You can complete many steps, like background checks and home study interviews, even if a family member is still working to access additional financial benefits. 

      * Waive the financial requirement for relative placements on a case-by-case basis. Many child welfare systems have an exemption process that allows licensors to bypass the financial requirements for a relative placement if the placement is in the best interests of the child. 

      * Make sure that an exemption process is well-documented and easy for new licensors to learn and follow. 

      * Set a policy eliminating financial requirements for relative placements. There are no minimum financial requirements set by the federal government for foster parents, only that “applicants must be financially stable to meet their family’s needs prior to placing a foster child in the home.” Your state can modify licensing requirements to eliminate asking relative placements for financial information. However, we still believe ensuring the financial stability of traditionally licensed foster homes is a good practice.
    costs:
      - Staff training time to learn new policies
      - Cost of providing application assistance
    benefits:
      - Increases the number of licensed relative placements

  - heading: License homes while social distancing
    title: license-homes-while-social-distancing
    about: >-
      Some child welfare systems have paused licensing for some or all new
      families in order to limit in-person contact, even though federal
      regulations do not require the licensing process to be conducted in
      person. Delays caused by stopping licensing can mean losing homes,
      especially relative placements, in a time when placement options are
      already severely limited. 


      Licensing new foster homes with minimal physical contact by conducting everything by email, phone, and video (except for fingerprinting and a single in-person safety walkthrough) can limit any delays and prevent the loss of placement options.
    how: >-
      * Conduct the initial safety walkthrough over video, during which case
      workers can identify safety concerns and make compliance plans. The final
      safety walkthrough can then be conducted in person, during a focused visit
      of no more than 20 minutes. 

      * For emergency relative placements, the in-person final safety walkthrough can be combined with the placement visit. Any follow-ups can be conducted over video. 

      * Conduct interviews over phone or video. If families lack technology equipment, connect them with [free Lifeline phone service](https://data.usac.org/publicreports/CompaniesNearMe/Download/Report) and [free Internet services](https://thinkofus.gitbook.io/command-center/resources/foster-youth/technology#i-cannot-afford-to-buy-access-to-the-internet). You may also be able to [use federal funding to secure equipment for families](https://thinkofusteam.app.box.com/s/joy9mrzgr4yjw997tjdi5dib1z6f1y4v).

      * Resolve minor pending items with photos.

      * Prioritize in-home and community-based fingerprinting. Mobile Livescan units reduce in-person time by allowing you to combine fingerprinting with the final safety walkthrough. Community-based fingerprinting sites like UPS stores remain open as essential businesses and provide a stress-free, fast environment for applicants to complete this requirement. 

      * Eliminate or temporarily suspend other in-person requirements. If your process requires a medical evaluation, allow a medical professional to complete the paperwork based on patients records or via a telehealth visit. 

      * Invest in online solutions that allow families to complete and track paperwork, attend and track orientations and trainings, and upload key documents. 

      * If your child welfare system has a unique requirement, like tuberculosis tests, evaluate whether such a unique requirement is necessary and remove or suspend it if possible.
    costs:
      - Software cost for online tracking system for families
      - Potential cost of mobile fingerprinting machine
    benefits:
      - "Limiting in-person contact while also limiting delays in licensing "
      - Prevents the loss of placement options
      - May make it easier for families to complete all or some of the
        requirements
    outcome: >-

    title: offer-online-foster-parent-training
    about: >-
      Many agencies have paused their resource family training and licensing
      efforts during the pandemic. However, the need for safe placement options
      for foster children can’t afford to wait. 


      By offering online training and online or telephone recruitment and orientation events, you can continue to license families while limiting in-person contact.
    how: >-
      * Use an existing online foster parent training. The Caregiver Core
      Training (CCT) is an online system developed by the Alliance for Child
      Welfare Excellence in Washington State. You can view their training
      materials
      [here](https://allianceforchildwelfare.org/project/learn-more-about-caregiver-core-training-online).
      If you think this is a viable option for your child welfare agency, you
      can contact Christina Coad at the Alliance directly
      ([ccoad@uw.edu](mailto:ccoad@uw.edu)). 

      * Conduct telephone orientations. Washington, D.C. developed an approach for conducting orientation sessions over the phone which was well received by families who attended. The agency provided a PowerPoint [presentation](https://www.childwelfareplaybook.com/assets/CFSA_Recruitment_Orientation_March_2020_Pride.pptx) for attendees to follow along and had a foster parent on the line to offer a real-world perspective.

      * Conduct online orientations. You can use the same slide deck and materials as you would for an in-person orientation, or add an interactive element by using a platform like [Google Forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/) to create a [scored quiz](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/7032287?hl=en). If your agency uses [Binti](https://binti.com/), you can provide an online orientation video for families to watch. Afterwards, families can complete a quiz in order to get credit.

      * Convert your own in-person training to online training. If you prefer to use your own training instead of an existing online training, you can convert your materials. 

      * Follow promising practices for online training. In developing their own online training, Michigan identified several promising practices: 

      * * Offer an online option for families to connect with one another. You can create a closed Facebook group for each class to help participants build connections and form a support group.
        * Schedule frequent classes. For two-parent households, this will allow parents to more easily switch between attending the training and spending time with children. 
        * Keep classes short. A full-day class is often too long for many participants to do online. Build in short breaks throughout the class so that participants don’t disengage.
        * Set online meeting guidelines before the first class. Not all participants will be familiar with online meetings. Guidelines can include general expectations, online meeting manners (i.e. how to dress appropriately, when to mute), and instructions on using the technology. Leave time at the beginning of the meeting to assist with any technical difficulties.
        * Include an interactive element, such as a questionnaire for each session to make sure that parents understand the material as the trainer covers it. Cut any hands-on activities that can’t easily be done remotely. Instead, stop to discuss the material more often. 
        * Cap the class at approximately 20 people to make sure that everyone can engage. 
        * You can contact Jessica Sweet at Michigan DHHS if you have any questions ([SweetJ2@michigan.gov](mailto:SweetJ2@michigan.gov)).

      - Prevents the loss of placement options
    outcome: >-
      * Los Angeles County found that when given a choice, more than 90% of
      families (approximately 9,000 to date) opted to complete orientation
      online.

      * In addition to being convenient for families and vital during COVID-19, Los Angeles County found that online orientations reduce staff workloads and free up staff time for other priorities.
