    about: To speed up the process and reduce application costs, offer ways for
      people to submit background check requests electronically. When people
      submit requests by mail, this leads to longer wait times and more
      opportunity for clerical mistakes.
    how: >-
      * Create a secure, generic email address for receiving requests instead of
      using an individual’s account. This provides a consistent process that
      won’t be disrupted by staff transition or vacation time.

      * Make your request form computer friendly. Turn your current form into a fillable PDF, Google form, or a standard Microsoft Word document. Paper forms have to be completed and scanned, creating additional barriers to submitting them — and then for reading them.

      * Provide an online portal for accepting background check requests the next time your agency updates the website.

      checks — commonly called Adam Walsh checks — vary quite a bit from state
      to state. To get foster families approved faster, start out-of-state
      background checks early.
    how: >-
      * Ask prospective foster families if they’ve lived out-of-state during
      your initial meeting with them — or even before, when you can.

      * Find the relevant Adam Walsh/out-of-state background check forms, either in your state or county’s Adam Walsh database or on the other state’s website.

      * Take a laptop to orientation for people interested in being foster parents and help them fill out online background check forms.

      * Take paper background check forms and make sure people understand how to fill them out.

      * If any of the background check forms require notarization, arrange for a volunteer notary to attend orientation and sign off on multiple forms at once.

    about: >-
      Social media is widely used across cultural, geographic, and economic
      groups. This makes social media a powerful and unique tool for finding
      family members of youth in foster care. 


      Other people-finding tools — like credit searches — have limited databases. For example, you have to have a credit history to appear in most of them.
    how: >-
      Search popular social media sites like Facebook for known family members,
      such as a youth’s parents or older siblings. From there, look through
      public messages, photos, and friend lists to identify additional
      connections and message them. 


      Before you start using social media for family finding, create a policy to guide staff. Cover topics like:


      * **Limiting accounts** — Provide official shared work accounts or have staff create  accounts that they only use for work. Don’t allow workers to use their personal accounts for family finding.  

      * **Confidentiality** — Don’t share private information through social media messages. Just as you would leave a generic voicemail when trying to identify kin, encourage social media contacts to reach out to you directly for follow-up.

      * **Respecting family privacy** — If a public child welfare account were to “friend” a possible family member, that would publicly reveal that the family member is having an interaction with child welfare. Workers should not update profiles, post public messages, or “friend” other accounts when using official work accounts for family finding. 

      * **Making staffing decisions** — Decide if a central team will conduct social media family finding activities, or if all workers will be granted access. There are pros and cons to both approaches.

      * **Unblocking social media sites** — Management may have to meet with IT to have certain social media sites unblocked from the network.

  - heading: Ask about connections repeatedly over time
    title: ask-about-connections
    about: >-
      The beginning of foster care is a difficult and emotional time for
      children and their families. Both children and adults may be too stressed
      or afraid to share a complete list of connections during an initial
      meeting. 


      Reduce the risk that children will permanently lose important connections by checking in regularly about their networks. Different timing and questions often uncover more connections. And when children are in foster care for a while, they may also develop new relationships with people who can provide vital support. 


      Invite youth and the known adults in their lives — like birth parents, family, other kin, and even foster parents — multiple times to share a list of supportive connections.
    how: >-
      * Review the list of known connections at recurring planning meetings. Ask
      all participants if they can think of anyone who is missing.

      * Try different approaches for learning about connections, like: Who picks you up from school? Who would you call if you got locked out of your home? Who did you see at your last family gathering? Who do you miss?

        * **Michigan**’s policy: “The relative search must begin prior to the child’s removal from the home and continues until legal permanency for the child has been achieved or case closure… Caseworkers must pursue the identification and notification of relatives and document the initial and ongoing efforts in the investigation report and each case service plan.”

        * **Ohio** is developing a new quality hearing court guide that includes prompting for the identification of missing supportive adults. It will guide the judge or magistrate to ask participants about whether relatives have been explored, pursued, and where they are in the process. It will also prompt courts to ask about kinship placement and whether the caregiver is linked with training, services and financial support.

        * **Rhode Island** connects with foster youth in group homes over Zoom meetings to ask about supportive connections.

        * **Virginia**’s policy is to ask about supportive adults annually and at every placement change.

        * In **Washington State**, every Family Team Decision Meeting includes asking participants to identify supportive connections.

    heading: Ask youth about supportive adults
    about: >-
      Youth are often placed in general foster care or in group homes when they
      have placement options with adults they already know and trust.


      Ask youth, both at initial removal and at regular intervals afterwards, about the supportive adults in their lives. Even young children may be able to tell you about the important people in their lives.
    how: >-
      * Supervisors of child welfare workers can make it a practice to regularly
      ask, “What did the youth say?”

      * Ask youth about their supportive connections at every placement change, and at regular intervals — annually, for example.

      * Phrase inquiries carefully so that young people don’t feel like they have to supply a placement option or they will be homeless. Helpful prompts include: “Who came to your last family gathering?” and “Who would you call if you needed a ride home from school?”

      * Help youth stay connected to supportive adults, even when they’re not a placement option. Create opportunities for regular phone calls, visits, or other contact.

  - heading: Ask family members for more family members
    title: ask-family-members-for-more-family-members
    about: >-
      When you connect with a youth’s kin, make it a point to always ask them if
      they know of other potential kin, whether they may be current connections
      to the child or family members that they haven’t yet met.


      Children can’t have too many adults who care about them. Most youth enter foster care with more connections than they leave with. Making sure to ask kin you know about to help identify additional kin, especially if children are too young to share on their own, can create a broader supportive network.
    how: >-
      * Make it a standard practice to ask kin about other kin during initial
      and ongoing kin contacts

      * Add a question like, “Are there other connections that we should know about?” to any kinship-finding form letters or standard messages.

      * Ask supportive adults who attend planning meetings if there are others who should be in attendance.

      * **[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/):** Look at public photos, posts, and friend lists to find family members.
    about: >-
      Effective family-finding requires a specialized skill set, from being
      savvy with social media to engaging newfound kin without scaring them. Not
      every case worker has these skills, and most already have demanding
      workloads. 


      A small team dedicated to finding family will help:


      * Free up case workers for other tasks

      * Test out promising new strategies and standardize effective practices 

      * Save money on subscription-based family-finding tools


      Form a dedicated family-finding team for your child welfare system, instead of relying on individual case workers to find kin for the children on their caseload.
    how: >-
      * Create a new team or department for family finding.

      * Charge this new team with specific tasks, like:

        * Using family-finding tools
        * Making initial contacts with potential kin
        * Establishing plans for staying in touch with kin
        * Searching for more kin at regular intervals
        * Prioritizing kin searches for children who are currently placed with non-kin
      * Put processes in place to ensure regular communication and collaboration across teams. Even with a dedicated team, finding kin is still everyone’s responsibility. Other case workers, planning meeting attendees, and young people are all resources for identifying and locating more kin.
    outcome: Member systems with dedicated family-finding teams report
      higher-than-average rates of kin placement.

      * Include all important connections, even if they aren’t legal or blood relatives.

      * Use the tree to generate new leads and to keep track of your contacts and progress.

      * [The Extreme Family Finding Project](https://www.fosteradopt.org/family-permanency/extreme-family-finding/) — which has a 95% success rate — recommends a genogram have at least 150-200 people on it.

  - heading: Make sure supportive adults have a robust presence at planning meetings
    title: supportive-adults-have-robust presence
    about: Most youth leave foster care with fewer connections than they entered
      with. However, most supportive adults want to be more involved in
      supporting the youth in their lives. Keeping these adults engaged and
      involved in case planning can help keep youth from exiting care without
      connections. Invite at least three times as many supportive adults as paid
      staff members to planning meetings to maximize the benefits of this
      support network.
    how: >-
      * Redesign your planning meeting invitation - The invitation should serve
      as a prompt and remind staff to invite as many supportive adults as they
      can, ideally three times as many supportive adults as paid staff members. 

      * Redesign your meeting sign in sheet - Provide enough room for supportive adults to sign in for in-person meetings. For example, you might have four times as many lines in the “supportive adult” area than in the “staff” area. 

      * Ask youth about supportive adults in their lives - Staff should make sure that supportive adults are aware of and invited to planning meetings. You might even ask youth to suggest a supportive adult themselves. 

      * Keep track of meeting attendance - With a simple spreadsheet, you can keep track of the breakdown of roles at planning meetings. Use this information to keep track of progress towards the goal of having three times as many supportive adults as paid staff in attendance.
    costs:
      - " Time to implement form and workflow changes"
    benefits:
      - Supportive adults remain engaged and involved with youth
      - Youth less likely to lose connections during care
    outcome: Olmsted County, MN demonstrated significantly better outcomes for older
      foster youth when a ratio of 3:1 supportive adults to paid staff attended

        their role (e.g. CASA, supportive adult, paid staff). They do this in a
        simple Excel spreadsheet, with regular exports from their IT system.

        * **Ohio** has Youth Centered Permanency Round Tables (YCPRT) running in several counties. For YCPRTs, the youth is asked to bring a support person to the meeting. It can be anyone: a caregiver, a friend of the family, a member of the family, or anyone the youth feels is supportive of them. That can also initiate more conversations and discussion about permanency options and supports for the youth. One youth asked his fast food manager to come with him, and the manager didn’t even know he was in foster care. The manager ended up adopting him!

        * In **Ohio**, the practice for maintaining connections is: any youth 14 and over is able to have two support persons join in on the family team meetings and case plan meetings. That helps to initiate discussion of any other support persons available to the child.

    title: Use-expansive-legal-definition-of-kin
    about: >-
      Being placed in kinship care can often be a more stable placement for
      youth when compared to placement in a group home or foster home with other
      unrelated youth. By staying in a familiar setting, youth will experience
      fewer disruptions and will be able to better maintain their existing
      relationships. Using an expansive legal definition of kin will allow staff
      to find more placement options for youth more quickly. 


      Even if a connection cannot serve as a placement, youth need as many supportive adults around them as possible. Maintaining an expansive legal definition of kin will allow you to create a broader support system for youth.
    how: >-
      * When asking youth or supportive connections about placement options,
      make it clear that a kinship connection does not need to be a blood
      relation. You can also ask about family friends, teachers or the spouses
      of relatives. Some agencies consider these relationships to be “fictive
      kin.”

      * By asking about connections repeatedly over time, you can include important relationships that a youth has developed since entering care.

      * Some agencies will verify a relationship with a non-kin placement through conversations with the child, a parent or a third party such as a teacher or [clergy](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/foster-care/kinship-care).
