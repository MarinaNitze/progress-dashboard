  **Our goal is to create a public, actionable playbook documenting practices
  that can be easily replicated and scaled by others.**


  The Child Welfare Playbook is a collection of promising practices in service of the following five goals:


  1. **No child enters foster care when prevention services could keep them safe instead.** The federal government estimates up to 60% of children are in foster care because they are poor. These children should never be removed.

  2. **If a child must enter foster care for safety reasons, they should immediately be placed with an adult they already know and trust.** That placement should also be supported financially (and otherwise) to keep that child either permanently, or until they can return home safely. A plan must be made and adhered to for keeping that child connected with their entire original support network (of family, friends, or teachers) during their time in foster care.

  3. **If a child must enter foster care for safety reasons, and they do not have any adult connections, they should immediately be placed with an adult who fully meets their needs.** This means an adult who speaks the same language, lives in the same school district, and is willing to be a long-term placement. The child should be able to stay with this placement until they can return home or, if reunification is truly not possible, with whom they can stay forever.

  4. **No child should ever live in a group home. While inpatient hospitalization may be necessary for short-term treatment, every child should live with a family.** This is possible even for the highest-needs children with the right wraparound and financial support, which is still less expensive than group homes.

  5. **A child’s demographics should not impact their likelihood of being removed.** Race, ethnicity, and/or socioeconomic status should not impact a child’s likelihood of being removed into foster care, or of achieving permanency if they must be removed.


  **The Playbook is the result of a collaboration between states at the cutting edge of this work and [New America’s Public Interest Technology team](https://www.newamerica.org/public-interest-technology/), in partnership with the [Foster America](https://www.foster-america.org/) and [Think of Us](https://www.thinkof-us.org/).**
membership: >-
  Any state, county (in county-administered systems), or private agency is
  welcome to join us. We also welcome input from any individuals or
  organizations with expertise and promising practices to share.


  **There is absolutely no cost to participate and the commitment is just two hours a month.**
howItWorks: >-
  * Every month, we focus on a specific topic area (e.g. home inspections,
  foster parent training, increasing kin licensing). We will schedule a one-hour
  “interview” with your subject matter expert(s) for the topic to gather
  information.

  * Everyone joins a one-hour webinar where we share key findings and promising practices from existing pilots and national experts, and suggest cross-state projects.

  * You will receive a personalized follow-up with recommendations for your specific processes.

  * Optionally, we can also hold a 1:1 follow-up call to go over more in-depth recommendations for your team, and to provide any implementation help you may need.

  * Promising practices and positive results will be captured here in the online Foster Care Playbook, including actionable collateral like example checklists and contracts.
benefitsOfMembership: >-
  * Promising practices for improving your processes, in an actionable format

  * Opportunities to participate in cross-state improvement projects

  * Positive media coverage related to participation (always approved ahead of time)

  * Implementation assistance for adapting promising practices
