## About

**Looking for an evaluation of your state's foster parent licensing process? The Child Welfare Playbook is offering [recommendations at no cost to interested states](#freeEvaluation).**

**Our goal is to create a public, actionable playbook of promising practices that can be easily replicated and scaled by others.**

The Child Welfare Playbook is a collection of promising practices to end adverse placements in foster care.


An adverse placement is when a child:
* Enters foster care when prevention services could have effectively prevented it, or
* Is placed in an institution,
* Is separated from their siblings, and/or
* Is moved far from their school or community (unless this is part of a kin placement)

The group is particularly supportive of kinship placements, and proud of our contributions to the [Kin-Specific Foster Home Approval Model Standards](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V30W6Ft_uEUpVIQ062wPh12HrYHNod0b43T25wrp190/).

This work would not be possible without the support of the A.L. Mailman Family Foundation, [Aviv Foundation](https://www.avivfoundation.org/), [Ballmer Group](https://www.ballmergroup.org/), [Beeck Center for Social Impact & Innovation](https://beeckcenter.georgetown.edu), [Doris Duke Foundation](https://www.dorisduke.org/) [Greenbridge Family Foundation](https://www.greenbridge.foundation/), [New America's New Practice Lab](https://www.newamerica.org/new-practice-lab/), [Schmidt Futures](https://www.schmidtfutures.com), [Stand Together Trust](https://standtogether.org), and [North Forty Group](https://raikesfoundation.org).

## Membership

Any state, county (in county-administered systems), or private agency is welcome to join us. We also welcome input from any individuals or organizations with expertise and promising practices to share.

To join, email [members@childwelfareplaybook.com](mailto:members@childwelfareplaybook.com)

**There is absolutely no cost to participate and the commitment is just two hours a month.**

## How it Works

* Every month, we focus on a specific topic area (e.g. partnering with schools,foster parent training, increasing kin licensing). We will schedule a one-hour “interview” with your subject matter expert(s) for the topic to gather information.

* Everyone joins a one-hour webinar where we share key findings and promising practices from existing pilots and national experts, and suggest cross-state projects.

* Optionally, we can also hold a 1:1 follow-up call to go over more in-depth recommendations for your team, and to provide any implementation help you may need.

* Promising practices and positive results will be captured here in the online Child Welfare Playbook, including actionable collateral like example checklists and contracts.

## Membership

* Promising practices for improving your processes, in an actionable format (e.g. sample contracts, checklists, policy language, etc.)

* Data about how current practices compare with other states (shared in a respectful manner with no shaming or ranking)

* Opportunities to participate in cross-state improvement projects

* Positive media coverage related to participation (always with your advance approval)

* Implementation assistance for adapting promising practices

## Current Members

* Every state, most territories, and many title IV-E tribes are current members of the group.
