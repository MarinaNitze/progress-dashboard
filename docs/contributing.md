# Editing Content

There are a few ways to contribute content to the site.

## Content Management System

This is the easiest way to add, edit, remove content from the site for most users.

### Setup / First Time

1. [Create a GitHub account](https://github.com/signup)
1. Verify your account email and [add two-factor authentication or a passkey](https://github.com/settings/security) 
1. Request that Coram IT adds you to the [Coram Playbook Contributors Team](https://github.com/orgs/coram-uk/teams/coram-playbook-contributors) within the coram-uk GitHub Org.
1. Navigate to [innovation.coram-i.org.uk/admin](https://innovation.coram-i.org.uk/admin) or [coram-playbook.netlify.app/admin](https://coram-playbook.netlify.app/admin) and sign-in with your GitHub account and authorize the application.

### Contributing

Once you're setup, you can edit content by going to [innovation.coram-i.org.uk/admin](https://innovation.coram-i.org.uk/admin) or [coram-playbook.netlify.app/admin](https://coram-playbook.netlify.app/admin).

## Code

For folks savvy at coding, an easier way to contribute might be through the code and GitHub directly. Steps are:

1. Clone this repository
1. Create a branch
1. Make your changes
1. Submit a pull request (which will trigger a preview to test your changes in the PR itself)
1. Either ask someone to review or merge it.

Content is located in the following locations:

- `/src/_data`: Text content
- `/src/images`: Picture content
